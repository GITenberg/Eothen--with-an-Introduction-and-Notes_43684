vii</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap"><i>Eothen</i></span> is the earliest work
of Alexander William Kinglake, best known as the historian of the
Crimean War.&nbsp; It is an account of a tour&mdash;or rather of
selected adventures which occurred during a tour&mdash;undertaken
in the Levant in 1834, but was not published until ten years
later.&nbsp; The biographical notices of the Author are somewhat
meagre, as by his dying directions all his papers were
destroyed.&nbsp; He was born near Taunton in 1809, and educated
at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, at which latter he is
said to have been the friend of Thackeray and Tennyson.&nbsp; On
leaving college he started on his Oriental tour with Lord
Pollington (the Methley of <i>Eothen</i>), and on returning to
England was called to the Bar at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, and
obtained a lucrative practice.&nbsp; But the life was too tame to
suit his taste.&nbsp; In 1845 he visited Algeria, and went
through a campaign with the flying column of St. Arnaud; and in
1854 went to the Crimea with Lord Raglan, and was present at the
<a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>battle
of Alma.&nbsp; On returning to England he decided to go into
politics, and was elected for Bridgewater in 1857 in the Liberal
interest.&nbsp; He seems to have been a poor speaker, and to have
exercised little parliamentary influence; but we are told that in
1859 he was strongly opposed to the Conspiracy Bill, which was
introduced after Orsini&rsquo;s attempt to murder Napoleon III.,
and that in 1860 he denounced the cession of Nice and Savoy to
France.&nbsp; In both cases he was apparently actuated by his
personal dislike of Napoleon, which is evident in his historical
works.&nbsp; In 1868 he was again returned for Bridgewater, but
unseated on petition, for bribery.&nbsp; One might have supposed
that he had acquired this habit in the East, but his biographers
assert that he knew nothing of the irregularities which were
committed by his agents.&nbsp; But the chief business of his
later life was the composition of the <i>History of the War in
the Crimea</i>, of which the first two volumes appeared in 1863,
and the seventh and eighth (completing the work) in 1887.&nbsp;
He died in 1891.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>His earlier and less ambitious, though perhaps more charming,
book was rejected by several publishers, but proved an immense
success.&nbsp; It caught the popular fancy at once, and after the
lapse of more than fifty years still maintains an honourable <a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>position.&nbsp; In the year after its first appearance
it passed through three editions, containing several variations
from the <i>editio princeps</i> which have attracted the
attention of those who are interested in bibliography.&nbsp; It
is only fair to reprint the book with these corrections, which
seem mostly due to the author&rsquo;s laudable desire for greater
accuracy.&nbsp; For instance, he was apparently seized with
qualms as to his assertion (end of chap. xiii.) that when he
emerged from the Dead Sea after bathing therein his &ldquo;skin
was thickly encrusted with sulphate of magnesia,&rdquo; and
cautiously substituted &ldquo;salts&rdquo; for the more chemical
expression.&nbsp; Yet I observe that the most recent
Encyclop&aelig;dia states that &ldquo;the water of the Dead Sea
is characterised by the presence of a large quantity of magnesian
salts,&rdquo; so perhaps his first statement was not so wrong
after all.&nbsp; He also found that he had talked of Jove when he
should have said Neptune in his account of the Troad, and,
conceiving a mistrust of the former deity, removed his name not
only from this passage but also from chap. xviii., in which he
altered &ldquo;That touch was worthy of Jove&rdquo; into
&ldquo;In that touch was true hospitality.&rdquo;&nbsp; I confess
that I think this regard for truth might have moved him to
expunge his account of the advances made to him by the young
ladies of Bethlehem (end of chap. xvi.); I cannot believe that
narrative to be even probable, but anyone may retort that my
scepticism is due to the absence of those attractive qualities
which Kinglake possessed.</p>
<p><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>In chap.
xvi. he says that shrouds are dipped in the holy water of the
Jordan and &ldquo;preserved as a burial dress which shall
inure&rdquo; (later editions &ldquo;enure&rdquo;) &ldquo;for
salvation in the realms of death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some critical
scholar of eminence should be called upon to emend or explain
this mysterious passage.&nbsp; At least, if people are allowed to
print such things in the nineteenth century what right have we to
emend the classical authors when they choose to be
unintelligible?</p>
<p>The truth is that <i>Eothen</i>, despite its great literary
merits, is often comfortably slipshod.&nbsp; And very properly
so, for if there is to be any correspondence between subject and
style, it must be inappropriate for a traveller recounting
confidentially his diversions and mishaps to adopt the
phraseology of Gibbon.&nbsp; Matthew Arnold, in his &ldquo;Essay
on the Literary Influence of Academies,&rdquo; selected the
<i>History of the Crimean War</i> as an example of what he called
the Corinthian style.&nbsp; <i>Eothen</i> certainly presents
specimens of this manner, but they are hardly characteristic; it
is often &ldquo;urbane,&rdquo; and has &ldquo;the warm glow,
blithe movement, and pliancy of life,&rdquo; which, according to
the critic&rsquo;s definition, Corinthians lack.&nbsp; It is not
devoid of unity, but it is many sided and kaleidoscopic.&nbsp;
The author varies from the trivial to the solemn, from boisterous
exuberance to careful austerity, from flippancy to rhapsody, and
is perhaps never quite serious.&nbsp; One wonders whether one is
reading a clever but somewhat slangy letter, or a long-meditated
<a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>essay
polished and repolished by incessant <i>labor
lim&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps between 1834 and 1844 he worked up
and rearranged old spontaneous effusions, as indeed his preface
suggests.&nbsp; He often writes like a schoolboy, and sometimes
like a philosopher; he is at his best when he records what he has
seen in phrases not without rhetoric and not without humour, but
distinct and clear as his own impressions.&nbsp; &ldquo;The foot
falls noiseless in the crumbling soil of an Eastern city, and
silence follows you still.&nbsp; Again and again you meet
turbans, and faces of men, but they have nothing for you&mdash;no
welcome&mdash;no wonder&mdash;no wrath&mdash;no scorn&mdash;they
look upon you as we do upon a December&rsquo;s fall of
snow&mdash;as a &lsquo;seasonable,&rsquo; unaccountable,
uncomfortable work of God, that may have been sent for some good
purpose to be revealed hereafter.&rdquo;&nbsp; How vivid and how
true!</p>
<p>But perhaps the reader may ask, as I ask myself, whether an
introduction to <i>Eothen</i> is really necessary.&nbsp; The book
is so simple and complete in itself that it seems to require no
explanation or commentary.&nbsp; But for the benefit of those who
are not acquainted with the Levant of to-day, it is well to
explain that the sixty-four years which have elapsed since
Kinglake made his Eastern tour have brought about important
changes in the extent, and some few in the condition, of the
Turkish Empire.&nbsp; The &ldquo;unchanging East&rdquo; is a
popular phrase which is only true in a very limited sense.&nbsp;
It has arisen chiefly from the habit of pious publishers of
representing Abraham in the <a name="pagexii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xii</span>costume of a modern Bedouin Sheikh,
and it is peculiarly audacious to apply it to regions like
Constantinople and Egypt, which have witnessed exceptional
vicissitudes and undergone remarkable changes,&mdash;political,
religious, and linguistic.&nbsp; It is however just to say that
the Turk is unchanging,&mdash;and it is to the presence of the
Turk that are due the peculiar characteristics of the Levant, as
the region visited by Kinglake may conveniently be termed; like
the Bourbons, he forgets nothing and learns nothing; as he was on
the day when he entered Europe, so he was in 1834 and so he is
now.&nbsp; The boundaries of Turkey have changed; there are now
no Pashas at Belgrade, or even at Sofia; and Ottoman territory is
no longer plague-stricken.&nbsp; But whenever one crosses the
Turkish frontier, one may find functionaries like the delightful
potentate of Karagholookoldour, and be conscious of effecting
within the space of a few hundred yards a change greater than can
be experienced in any amount of travel in other European
countries, including Russia.&nbsp; One passes from regions where
people have roughly the same habits and ideas as
ourselves&mdash;where they believe in political economy, get
drunk in public, sit upon chairs, and do not feel there is
anything indelicate in mentioning their wives&mdash;to a land
where people do none of these things, where the naked desolation
of the country at the side of the railway offers a startling
contrast to the smug prosperity of the Balkan States, where
people prefer to sit curled up on hard sofas, and where it <a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>is bad
taste to condole with a man on his wife&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>In 1834, the year of Kinglake&rsquo;s journey, Turkey in
Europe was considerably more extensive than at the present
day.&nbsp; Greece had already revolted and been recognised as an
independent state.&nbsp; Wallachia and Moldavia were in process
of securing their freedom.&nbsp; But the territories now known as
Bulgaria, Bosnia, and Herzegovina were still integral portions of
the Ottoman Empire; and though Servia (in which the scene of the
opening chapters of <i>Eothen</i> is laid) had been constituted a
principality under Milosh Obrenovich as prince, in 1830, several
of the fortresses were still garrisoned by Ottoman troops, which
accounts for the presence of the Pasha at Belgrade.&nbsp; It is
interesting to observe that though our Author must have proceeded
to Adrianople straight across Bulgaria, he never mentions the
name of that country.&nbsp; This apparently strange omission is
really quite natural.&nbsp; The Bulgarians, though in some ways
the most vigorous element among the Balkan races, passed through
greater trials than the Servians or Roumanians, and for a time
lost their national consciousness more completely.&nbsp; They
were nearer Constantinople, and therefore any political movement
was more easily kept in check; while all the religious and
educational establishments of the country were in the hands of
Greek priests who practically proscribed the Bulgarian
language.&nbsp; I have been informed by a gentleman who has
resided <a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiv</span>forty years in Turkey, that when he first entered the
Ottoman dominions every educated Bulgarian called himself a
Greek, and would have been ashamed to employ his national
designation, which was hardly in general use before the movement
of 1860.&nbsp; Another striking omission of <i>Eothen</i> is that
it contains hardly any allusion to the Sultan.&nbsp; At the
present day the descendant of Osman, who claims to be also the
successor of the Prophet, is a well-known figure to the British
public.&nbsp; The <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> familiarly calls him
&ldquo;The Shadow.&rdquo; <a name="citationxiv"></a><a
href="#footnotexiv" class="citation">[xiv]</a>&nbsp; The friends
of the Armenians hold him personally responsible for the
massacres; and a modern Kinglake, even if bent on avoiding
&ldquo;political disquisitions,&rdquo; would certainly describe
the Selamlik or weekly visit of the Sovereign to the
mosque.&nbsp; You cannot travel in Turkey without hearing the
name of &ldquo;Our Master&rdquo; (Effendimiz) or &ldquo;the
Imperial Person&rdquo; (Zat-i-Shahane) daily mentioned, and
feeling that his wishes (which usually do not coincide with those
of European travellers, and affect the minutest details) are the
only real power in the country.&nbsp; This state of things is due
almost entirely to the personal energy of the present occupant of
the Ottoman throne, who for good or evil has succeeded in
concentrating all power into his hands, and in displaying the
greatest <a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xv</span>example of practical autocracy ever seen.&nbsp; In 1834
Mahmoud was Sultan, one of the most vigorous of Ottoman princes,
but then near his end, and doubtless wearied out by a reign of
constant reverse and ineffectual efforts at reform.</p>
<p>The Armenian question, like the Bulgarian, is of recent date,
and we consequently find that Kinglake says as little of the one
as of the other; but he often speaks of the doings of Mehemet Ali
and his son Ibrahim Pasha, which at this period formed one of the
chief preoccupations of the Porte.&nbsp; Mehemet Ali was a native
of Cavalla who held a military command in Egypt.&nbsp; In the
troubles which succeeded the French occupation of that country,
at the beginning of the century, he succeeded in making himself
head of the popular party in Cairo, ousted the Turkish Governor,
and established himself in his place.&nbsp; He was recognised by
the Porte in 1805, and the Khediviate was subsequently made
hereditary in his family.&nbsp; At this time the Mamluks (or
descendants of the Turkish Guard instituted by the Sultans of
Egypt in the thirteenth century) occupied a position somewhat
similar to that of the Janissaries at Constantinople.&nbsp;
Mehemet Ali, like Sultan Mahmoud, felt that this military
<i>imperium in imperio</i> rendered fixed Government impossible,
and determined to consolidate his own rule by breaking the power
of the Mamluks.&nbsp; He did so by inviting their leaders to a
banquet, at which they were surprised and massacred.&nbsp; The
Sultan, in return for his recognition <a name="pagexvi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>of Mehemet Ali as ruler of Egypt,
made use of him during some years to keep in order various
rebellious provinces of the Empire.&nbsp; He was first ordered to
quell the Wahabi insurrection in Arabia, and his campaign there
is alluded to in chap. xviii.&nbsp; These people were a sort of
Mohammedan Puritans <a name="citationxvi"></a><a
href="#footnotexvi" class="citation">[xvi]</a> who had made
themselves masters of the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina.&nbsp;
Mehemet Ali sent against them his son Tosun, who captured Mecca
in 1813, but died, and was replaced by his younger brother
Ibrahim Pasha, who is often mentioned in <i>Eothen</i>.&nbsp; He
finally concluded the Wahabi war in 1818, and is next heard of
fighting against Greece, which was beginning the struggle for
independence.&nbsp; Mehemet Ali was again called upon to assist
the Sultan in suppressing rebellion, and again sent his son to
represent him.&nbsp; Ibrahim captured Missolonghi in 1825, but
was defeated in 1827 by the united fleets at Navarino, under Sir
Edward Codrington, and retired from Greece.&nbsp; In return for
these services Mehemet Ali claimed that the Pashalik of Syria
should be added to his dominions.&nbsp; The Sultan refused the
request of his powerful vassal; but the latter picked a quarrel
with the Turkish governor of Syria, and sent Ibrahim to invade
the province.&nbsp; Ibrahim not only made a triumphal entry into
Damascus, but defeated the Turkish Army at Beilan and advanced
into Asia <a name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvii</span>Minor, where he routed a second force, sent against
him by the Sultan, near Konia, in December 1832.&nbsp; The
defeated Turkish troops joined the Egyptians, Ibrahim advanced
victoriously to Broussa, and had Constantinople at his
mercy.&nbsp; The Sultan in his extremity called the Russians to
his assistance.&nbsp; The Treaty of Unkiar Iskelesi was concluded
in 1833; Ibrahim was obliged to retire, but the Pashaliks of
Syria and Adana were given to Mehemet Ali, and treated with great
rigour, as mentioned in chap. xv.&nbsp; At the time of
Kinglake&rsquo;s visit to Egypt the plague seems to have been the
one absorbing preoccupation of everyone in Cairo, and we learn
little from him of the normal state of the country at this
period.&nbsp; The most remarkable of his Egyptian sayings is the
prophecy at the end of the chapter called &ldquo;The
Sphinx.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Englishman leaning far over to
hold his loved India will plant a firm foot on the banks of the
Nile and sit in the seats of the faithful.&rdquo;&nbsp; To have
made this prediction at a time when India was still under the
Company, when we had no interests in North-East Africa or the Red
Sea, before the Suez Canal was a serious project, perhaps before
we had occupied Aden, <a name="citationxvii"></a><a
href="#footnotexvii" class="citation">[xvii]</a> is indeed an
example of no ordinary political foresight.</p>
<p>Such was the political condition of the lands <a
name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>which
Kinglake visited, and of many aspects of which he gives a most
living picture.&nbsp; In his diverting preface he disclaims all
intention of being instructive, of describing manners and
customs, still less of discussing political and social
questions.&nbsp; Perhaps his narrative sometimes reminds the
reader of his statement (chap. viii.) that a story may be false
as a mere fact but perfectly true as an illustration.&nbsp; Some
great writers impart durability to their work by selecting from a
mass of details such traits as are important and characteristic,
and passing lightly over what is transitory.&nbsp; For instance,
the main impression left by Thackeray&rsquo;s novels is not that
the life there described is old-fashioned, but that it is in
essentials the life of to-day.&nbsp; So, too, in <i>Eothen</i> a
reader acquainted with the East hardly notices
anachronisms.&nbsp; Judged as a description of the Levant of
1898, it is inaccurate, or rather inadequate, almost exclusively
on account of its omissions.&nbsp; But the principal
descriptions, incidents, and portraits&mdash;the Mohammedan
quarter at Belgrade, the conversation between the Pasha and the
Dragoman, the meeting of the two Englishmen in the desert,
Dimitri and Mysseri&mdash;are, if considered as types, as true to
nature to-day as they were sixty years ago, and doubtless will be
sixty years hence.</p>
<p>Kinglake treats the Levant in the only way it ought to be
treated if it is to be enjoyed&mdash;half-seriously.&nbsp; Those
whom business or philanthropy <a name="pagexix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xix</span>oblige to devote to it any real
exertion, sentiment, or interest, lay up for themselves nothing
but disillusion and disappointment, for, whether they are
fascinated by the picturesque and manly virtues of the Moslems,
or roused to honourable indignation by the slaughter and
oppression of their fellow-Christians, they will find in the end
that, as Lord Salisbury once said, they have put their money on
the wrong horse.&nbsp; In the Eastern Derby there are no winning
horses.&nbsp; One after another they have all disappointed their
backers; the faults of Eastern Christendom brought about and
still keep up the rule of the Turk, and few who have an adequate
knowledge of the facts of the case believe either that the
Christians are happy under that rule or that they furnish in
themselves the elements of anything much better.</p>
<p>Yet this dreary tragedy&mdash;this daily round of oppression
and misgovernment, varied by outbursts of interracial
fury&mdash;has a brighter side.&nbsp; To the mere spectator, to
the intelligent traveller with literary taste and a sense of
humour, the surface of Levantine life is a stream of perpetual
amusement, often broadening into comedy, and sometimes bursting
all bounds and breaking into a screaming farce.&nbsp; The number
and variety of races and languages afford infinite possibilities
of misunderstanding and mistranslation (which it must be admitted
are the basis of many good stories); the Orientalised European
and the Europeanised Oriental are alike inexpressibly
droll.&nbsp; Their very crimes have an element of the burlesque,
<a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xx</span>which
seems to disarm censure and remove the whole transaction to a
non-moral sphere where ordinary rules of right and wrong do not
apply.&nbsp; The Turk, if not precisely witty himself, is at
least the cause of wit in others.&nbsp; Extreme Asiatic dignity
amidst ludicrously undignified European surroundings, a mixture
of pomp and homeliness, power and childishness, give rise to
humorous anecdotes of a peculiar and very characteristic flavour,
examples of which may be found in several works besides
<i>Eothen</i>, notably Robert Curzon&rsquo;s <i>Monasteries of
the Levant</i>.&nbsp; Another excellent illustration is supplied
by Vazoff&rsquo;s <i>Under the Yoke</i>, a translation of which
has been published in English.&nbsp; It is an historical novel,
written by a Bulgarian burning with indignation against the
Ottoman rule.&nbsp; Yet the Turkish Caimmakam, as drawn by a
bitter enemy, is no bloody tyrant, but an exquisitely diverting
old gentleman whose every appearance is hailed by the reader with
impatient delight.&nbsp; As the violence of the Turk, so also the
dishonesty and corruption of the Rayah seem to lose their
enormity when viewed in this gentle, humorous light.&nbsp; The
swindling is so palpable, and yet so gravely decorous in its
external forms, that it ceases to shock; it is so universal that
in the end no one seems to have suffered much wrong.&nbsp; To
vary the celebrated remark about the Scilly Islanders, one may
say that these people gain a precarious livelihood by taking
bribes from one another.&nbsp; Again the elaborate and
ceremonious phraseology essential to all <a
name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>literary
composition in the East enables a writer to make intrinsically
preposterous assertions with a gravity which renders criticism
impossible.&nbsp; What reply can be given to the officials who
assert that Armenians commit suicide in order to throw suspicion
on certain excellent Kurds residing in their neighbourhood? or
who when called upon to explain why they have incarcerated a
foreign traveller under circumstances of extreme indignity,
blandly reply that &ldquo;the said gentleman was indeed
hospitably entertained in the Government buildings&rdquo;?</p>
<p>This last instance shows that Oriental travelling must not be
undertaken without due precautions.&nbsp; A certain retinue, and
sufficient influence to secure the courtesy of the authorities
(which Kinglake evidently had), are essential.&nbsp; With them
the traveller acquires a feeling, often manifest in
<i>Eothen</i>, that he is a sultan possessed of absolute
authority over his surroundings.&nbsp; There is just enough
hardship to make comparative comfort seem luxury, just enough
danger to make it pleasant, when all is over, to hear from what
perils one has escaped.&nbsp; Should, however, any reader be
inclined to use <i>Eothen</i> as a practical manual, he must be
cautious in following some of its precepts.&nbsp; Kinglake
constantly insists that intimidation, haughtiness, and defiance
of all regulations are the only means of impressing Orientals;
and chronicles with great satisfaction his own exploits in this
line, concluding with &ldquo;the Surprise of
Satalieh.&rdquo;&nbsp; What he says is true enough as long as the
Oriental believes that the <a name="pagexxii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxii</span>traveller is a prince in his own
country, and that any interference with his mad whims will bring
severe punishment.&nbsp; But unfortunately the secret is
out.&nbsp; Enlightened officials are well aware that many
Englishmen are not cousins of the Queen, and have a shrewd
suspicion that hindrances placed in the way of the prying
European are not displeasing to the Imperial Government.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Lord of London,&rdquo; who fifty years ago obtained a
firman which made every provincial official bow before him, may
now be kept waiting days or weeks for a travelling passport; and,
unless he uses tact as well as bumptiousness, may find himself in
a position to write to the <i>Times</i> about the interior of
Turkish provincial prisons, and become the subject of a Blue
Book.&nbsp; Still even now, if travellers will be cautious and
polite in dealing with people of whose language and customs they
are profoundly ignorant, and not bluster unless they know very
well what they are about (for I admit that bluster has its uses),
they will find travelling more interesting, diverting, and
enjoyable in the Levant than in any other part of the world.</p>
<p>I write these lines as I sit in the hall of the largest hotel
in New York, a newly arrived stranger, somewhat dazed by the
bustle and the glare.&nbsp; The whole establishment is on a
greater scale than anything else in the world&mdash;except its
own bills.&nbsp; Everything is made of gold and marble,
including, I fancy, the food&mdash;at least this hypothesis
plausibly reconciles the quality and texture of the viands with
the value <a name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiii</span>the vendors seem to attach to them.&nbsp; Enormous
lifts shoot their living freights up into spheres unseen, or
engulf them in abysmal chasms.&nbsp; All round people are ringing
electric bells, telephoning, telegraphing, stenographing,
polygraphing, and generally communicating their ideas about money
to their fellow-creatures by any means rather than the voice
which God put in the larynx for the purpose of quiet
conversation.&nbsp; On one side an operatic concert is being
performed, on the other porters and luggage jostle a brilliant
throng of fashionably dressed people.&nbsp; It is as if someone
had given an evening party at a railway station.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whirr! whirr! all by wheels! whizz! whizz! all by
steam!&rdquo; and electricity, as the immortal Pasha of
Karagholookoldour would have said.&nbsp; Now my mind (like the
Pasha&rsquo;s) comprehends locomotives, and I am an enthusiast
for progress, but amidst all the whizz and whirr and ringing of
electric bells, my memory turns somewhat regretfully to a hotel
where I resided not long ago in the &ldquo;Exalted
Country&rdquo;&mdash;that fine old Stamboul&rsquo;s jargon is so
much more soothing to the tongue than the strange abbreviations
and initials they use over here&mdash;which was certainly more
interesting, and not, I think, more uncomfortable than this
Transatlantic Caravanserai.&nbsp; Perhaps I shall write an
introduction congenial to the Shade of Kinglake (if indeed the
Shades are interested in new editions of their works) if instead
of instituting a comparison between the Levant of to-day and of
1834, I recount a journey to the town <a
name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxiv</span>of
Karakeui in the year of grace 1898, and describe the local
hotel.&nbsp; Let not the reader in pursuit of that &ldquo;sound
learning&rdquo; which Kinglake kept at arm&rsquo;s length rashly
identify Karakeui with the first town he finds on the map bearing
that name.&nbsp; The Turk has not a great variety of local
designations.&nbsp; When possible he adopts one from some other
language, treating it with the scant courtesy which long-winded,
infidel polysyllables deserve (<i>e.g.</i> Edirn&eacute;,
F&iacute;lib&eacute;, for Adrianople and Ph&iacute;lippopoli);
but when forced to have recourse to his own invention he calls
most places Karakeui (or Blacktown), except those which are
dubbed Oldtown, Newtown, or Whitetown.</p>
<p>It has been justly said that the East begins on the other side
of Vienna, but, out of deference to the susceptibilities of the
Magyars, who consider themselves in the van of civilisation, the
Orient Express affects to be extremely European during its
transit through Hungary.&nbsp; It bustles and shakes, and is very
uncomfortable.&nbsp; In Servia it is more at its ease, though it
still makes a pretence of thinking that time is money by only
stopping ten minutes at every station.&nbsp; In Bulgaria it
ceases to imitate Western ways, and becomes frankly Oriental,
reposing for half an hour at spots where there are no passengers
and no traffic.&nbsp; The part of the journey which lies on
Turkish territory follows a singularly tortuous and corkscrew
course, across a perfectly level plain which presents no obvious
engineering difficulties.&nbsp; The Porte confided the
construction of this line to <a name="pagexxv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>an eminent Israelite at a
remuneration of so much for every kilometre built.&nbsp; The
eminent Israelite was straightway possessed by the spirit of his
ancestors, and made a large fortune by laying the rails along a
road as lengthy and complicated as that selected by Moses when he
spent forty years in traversing a distance which anyone else can
accomplish in a few days.</p>
<p>On arriving in Turkey we are at once seized by the
representatives of the Board of Health.&nbsp; After all, times
have indeed changed since <i>Eothen</i> was written.&nbsp;
Instead of being put in quarantine by Europe, Turkey now puts
Europe in quarantine.&nbsp; It is true that good Moslems still
hold that men&rsquo;s souls leave their bodies when God calls
them, and count it impious to suppose that neglect or precaution
can hasten or delay the Divine summons.&nbsp; But though the
Porte are not disposed to amend the sanitary condition of Mecca,
they enforce quarantine regulations all round Constantinople with
fanatical rigour.&nbsp; This is due partly to the fears of the
Palace, and partly, I think, to a sense of humour.&nbsp; It is an
excellent joke to apply a parody of European rules to Europeans
in the name of sanitary science: to keep a set of fussy business
people waiting a few days because they have come from a country
which has not imposed quarantine on another country where there
has been a doubtful case of cholera, or to detain a ship with a
valuable cargo while embassies and merchants scream that
thousands of pounds are being <a name="pagexxvi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxvi</span>lost daily.&nbsp; On the present
occasion we are told we must wait a day under inspection, to see
if we develop the symptoms of any terrible malady, and are
accordingly lodged in damp little wooden huts on a muddy plain,
where we are certainly likely to fall ill even if hale and hearty
on arriving.&nbsp; Turkish soldiers prevent us from crossing an
imaginary line and contaminating the surrounding desert.&nbsp;
The quarantine doctor, however, explains to me that he has a
peculiar respect for my character, sanitary and general, and
would like to take a walk with me outside the limits of the
establishment.&nbsp; He has a remarkable pedigree.&nbsp; His
father was a Bohemian monk who found convent life too narrow for
his taste, and accordingly embraced Islam.&nbsp; Once within the
true fold he made up for lost time by marrying as many wives as
his new liberty allowed, and this is one of the results.&nbsp; He
confides to me that his one ambition is to wear decorations, and
that in return for his civilities strangers of distinction have
procured for him the orders of their respective countries.&nbsp;
The Siamese Minister, who recently passed through, made him a
Commander of the Order of the White Elephant.&nbsp; Could I not
obtain for him the Order of the Garter?&nbsp; Doubtless I possess
it myself.&nbsp; With blushing mendacity I lead him to believe
that I do, but explain that the distinction is only given to
Englishmen and not to foreigners.&nbsp; I see that he does not
believe me, and meditates revenge.&nbsp; Before we leave the
quarantine station we have to be <a name="pagexxvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxvii</span>disinfected.&nbsp; The doctor
attaches a garden hose to a reservoir filled with a fetid and
corrosive fluid.&nbsp; The victims are led up one by one by the
military authorities as if to execution, and the jet is turned
upon them, causing their garments to burst out into leprous
spots.&nbsp; I see by the doctor&rsquo;s eye that he means to
make me pay for my unfriendliness in the matter of the
decoration, and therefore, casting scruple to the winds, I assure
him that if he will only treat me gently he shall have the Fourth
Class of the Garter.&nbsp; He is at once all civility and
consideration, and when I am led up in front of his infernal
machine, directs an odoriferous douche to the right and left,
leaving me unwetted in the middle.</p>
<p>Truly the way into Turkey is beset with as many difficulties
as the road to paradise.&nbsp; After the quarantine comes the
Custom House.&nbsp; The entry of most things is absolutely
prohibited, and those which do enter pay a high duty.&nbsp; Books
are treated with incredible severity.&nbsp; No work is allowed to
pass the frontier which hints that the Turks were ever defeated,
or that the Ottoman Government or the Mohammedan religion have
any imperfections.&nbsp; Turkish officials having found by
experience that very little European literature comes up to their
high standard, simply confiscate as &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; every
publication which mentions Turkey or the Mohammedan East.&nbsp;
<i>Eothen</i>, even without the present highly seditious preface,
is placed on the index, as are also Shakespeare, Byron, Dante,
the <a name="pagexxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxviii</span><i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, Baedeker, and
Murray.&nbsp; In practice, of course, certain familiar
<i>argumenta ad hominem</i> modify this Draconian system, but
even the golden key sometimes fails to open the door.&nbsp; The
officials watch one another, and know that they are much more
likely to obtain a Turkish decoration by confiscating some
infamous historian who is not ashamed to say that the Turks were
once driven out of Hungary than they are to receive the Garter
for letting his calumnies in.&nbsp; But there is an end to all
troubles, even on the Turkish frontier, and at last we are
allowed to proceed to Karakeui, where I ultimately alight at the
hotel.</p>
<p>Karakeui lies on a plateau, under a range of snowy mountains
which glitter with strange distinctness in the pure translucent
air.&nbsp; A forest of minarets bears testimony to the piety of
the place.&nbsp; It is the sacred month of Ramazan, and at sunset
they will be festooned with lights and blaze like columns of
fire, while in the mosque below myriads of little oil lamps will
shed their soft glow on the bowing crowds, the plashing
fountains, and the names of saints and prophets blazoned on the
walls in green and red.&nbsp; In the streets is a motley throng
of men and animals.&nbsp; Strings of camels and pack-horses,
dogs, sheep, and turkeys are mixed up with the human crowd.&nbsp;
Bulgarians and Servians quarrel in the bazaar, and denounce one
another to the Turks.&nbsp; They each claim exclusive rights over
the only Christian Church, and the Governor, to end the dispute,
has shut it up <a name="pagexxix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxix</span>altogether.&nbsp; A few Greeks are occupied in making
large fortunes, and are ready to expatiate on the Hellenic Idea,
and to explain how, from a certain peculiar point of view, the
late war may be regarded as a victory for Greece.&nbsp;
Albanians, armed with many weapons, and with moustaches as long
as their own rifles, swagger through the crowd which respectfully
makes way for them.</p>
<p>The hotel is kept by an Armenian, who left his native village
on account of what are beautifully termed the
&ldquo;events&rdquo; which occurred there.&nbsp; Having been
inspired by these occurrences with a wholesome respect for the
followers of the Prophet, he is a little apt to recoup himself at
the expense of his co-religionists; but the local Ottoman
authorities, to whose care I am duly recommended as being
&ldquo;one of those who wish well to the Sublime
Government,&rdquo; have sternly informed him that I am not to be
fleeced.&nbsp; (I wonder if the Governor of New York would
address a similar warning to the proprietor of this hotel.)&nbsp;
The establishment is constructed in the form of a
quadrangle.&nbsp; The central space is a quagmire, wherein are
embedded, and, so to speak, held as hostages for payment, the
vehicles in which the travellers have arrived.&nbsp; The ground
floor of the surrounding buildings is devoted to stabling.&nbsp;
Outside the first floor, and above the aforesaid quagmire, runs a
gallery, from which open a number of cells, bare and whitewashed,
devoid of all furniture, but, contrary to what might be expected,
scrupulously <a name="pagexxx"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxx</span>clean.&nbsp; A marble bath is not, as in New York,
attached to each apartment, but in response to a suitable shout a
boy brings a brass jug and basin, pours water over your hands and
wipes them on an embroidered towel.&nbsp; There is no table and
no bed.&nbsp; When you are disposed to sleep, a pile of rugs is
spread on the floor.&nbsp; If you want to write, you naturally
sit on your heels and hold your paper in your hand&mdash;an
attitude which, at least in the case of Europeans, tends to
restrain exuberance and keep literary composition within due
limits.&nbsp; At meal times a little table like a high stool is
brought in.&nbsp; The guests squat round it on their heels, and
eat with their fingers out of a large saucer set on a broad tin
tray.&nbsp; Turkish dinners consist of a quantity of dishes,
generally at least seven or eight, and sometimes as many as
twenty; but each is only tasted and rapidly removed.&nbsp; At
first it looks somewhat mysterious when people apparently wrap up
some pieces of string in brown paper and eat the parcel with
avidity.&nbsp; But the string is cheese drawn out like very
attenuated vermicelli, and the brown paper sheets of very thin
bread which serve as a tablecloth and napkin as well as for
food.&nbsp; During Ramazan no Moslem may eat, drink, or smoke
between sunrise and sunset.&nbsp; The latter phenomenon is
announced by a cannon, and some minutes before the gun fires a
hungry crowd is gathered round the table waiting for the blessed
sound.&nbsp; Then follows half an hour of rapid, silent
nutrition, for Turks do <a name="pagexxxi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxi</span>not talk at table.&nbsp;
Afterwards, an hour or more of prayer; and then the earlier part
of the night, until at least twelve or one, is devoted to
visiting or attending the puppet show called Karagy&ouml;z. <a
name="citationxxxi"></a><a href="#footnotexxxi"
class="citation">[xxxi]</a>&nbsp; Half an hour before dawn people
go round the town beating drums, and the faithful hurriedly take
a last meal before the morning cannon announces the dawn.</p>
<p>My neighbour in the room on the right is a spy appointed by
the Imperial Government to watch over my doings.&nbsp; He is a
charming companion, and I fancy has a very pretty talent for the
composition of imaginative literature.&nbsp; My only regret is
that I have never seen the daily reports which he draws up on my
conduct.&nbsp; They are, I believe, replete with incident, and
are excellent specimens of a new and interesting variety of
fiction.&nbsp; The room on my left is occupied by the Christian
Vice-Governor of the Province, who was appointed some months ago
under immense pressure from the Powers, met by such resistance on
the part of the Porte that one might have supposed his nomination
was a deadly blow to the Turkish Empire.&nbsp; It is a wise plan
of the Porte&rsquo;s never to make the most trivial concession
without opposing a resistance, which is often successful, and
always seems to enhance the importance of <a
name="pagexxxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxii</span>the
point in dispute.&nbsp; But the concession once made, means are
soon discovered to deprive it of all its value, and the positions
of victors and vanquished in the game prove to be reversed.&nbsp;
In the present case the Christian Vice-Governor found that none
of his co-religionists were disposed to let him lodgings; and the
local authorities, with a tender solicitude for his welfare,
represented to him that there was a strong feeling against him in
the town, and that he would be much more comfortable in the
hotel; predicting (like Kinglake&rsquo;s prophet, Damoor) that if
he went out into the streets, or meddled in the administration,
he would arouse that excitable sentiment known as Mussulman
religious feeling.&nbsp; Like the Jews of Safet, the Christian
Vice-Governor thought that the predictions of such practical men
were not to be disregarded, and takes his ease in his inn with as
good a grace as he can muster.&nbsp; Another interesting occupant
of the hotel is the Turkish inspector of Reforms.&nbsp; To
rightly understand the duties of this functionary it must be
remembered that the Turkish Government is divided into two parts,
which have no connection with one another: <i>firstly</i>, the
real Government, which is hard to comprehend, but of which one
gets a dim idea by observation on the spot; and <i>secondly</i>,
the show Government, intended to impress Europe, and having as
chief practical result the enrichment of telegraphic
agencies.&nbsp; Two common manifestations of the show Government
are circulars to the Powers, and commissions despatched to the <a
name="pagexxxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxiii</span>Provinces to rectify abuses.&nbsp; The present
Commissioner has come to inspect reforms, and from the official
language used respecting him it may be supposed that his mission
is to tend and water the new institutions which are springing up
like a luxuriant vegetation in a favourable climate, but at the
same time to exercise a fatherly control, prevent the country
from rushing into downright republicanism, and not permit the
Christians to positively oppress their weaker Mohammedan
brethren.&nbsp; He is a very affable man, with a broad, smiling
face, and an amiable rotundity of person which causes his
gorgeous uniform to burst its buttons and gape at critical
points.&nbsp; He pays me long visits for the purpose of political
discussion, being, as he calls it, <i>tout &agrave; fait dans les
id&eacute;es lib&eacute;rales</i>, and in order that this
outpouring of radical views may not be interrupted, he brings a
soldier to mount guard over the door.&nbsp; No tortures could
make me disclose the Commissioner&rsquo;s confidences.&nbsp; I
will merely observe that the long fasts of Ramazan are irksome to
an enlightened mind, and that liberal theologians hold that a
mixture of brandy and champagne does not fall under the
Prophet&rsquo;s ban, inasmuch as it cannot accurately be
described as either wine or spirits.</p>
<p>Very different is the room at the end of the passage.&nbsp; No
guard is needed here.&nbsp; The door stands proudly open, and all
the world may see that no crumb of bread or drop of water enters
from sunrise to sunset.&nbsp; In the middle of a low sofa sits,
<a name="pagexxxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxiv</span>cross-legged, a Hodja, clad in striped silk.&nbsp; He
is no ordinary country parson, but a noted preacher invited to
tour in the provinces during Ramazan, and hold what in other
countries would be called revival meetings.&nbsp; His thin
nervous face shows that he is not a real Turk.&nbsp; Probably he
is of Arab extraction, and in any case he burns with a Semitic
indignation against those who &ldquo;ascribe companions to
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Round him sit in a solemn circle the notables
of the town,&mdash;stout, devout men of the churchwarden order,
who, to judge from the heavy sighs and puffs which they
occasionally emit, do not share the Hodja&rsquo;s fierce joy in
trampling on the desires of the flesh.&nbsp; To-morrow he will
preach in the Great Mosque with a sword in his hand, in token
that the building was once a Christian Church and has been won
from the infidel.&nbsp; I tell the Commissioner for Reforms that
I think this dangerous and injudicious.&nbsp; He explains that
the whole point of the ceremony lies in the fact that the sword
is sheathed, as a token that religious discord is at an end, and
that an era of mutual love and toleration has commenced.&nbsp;
But when I think of that nervous, fanatical face, the green
garments, the ample turban, the amulets and the sword, I cannot
help suspecting that it is better to be a Christian traveller
than a Christian resident at Karakeui.</p>

xxxv</span>Preface to the First Edition</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Addressed by the<br />
Author to One of His Friends</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you first entertained the idea
of travelling in the East you asked me to send you an outline of
the tour which I had made, in order that you might the better be
able to choose a route for yourself.&nbsp; In answer to this
request I gave you a large French map, on which the course of my
journeys had been carefully marked; but I did not conceal from
myself that this was rather a dry mode for a man to adopt when he
wished to impart the results of his experience to a dear and
intimate friend.&nbsp; Now, long before the period of your
planning an Oriental tour I had intended to write some account of
my Eastern travels.&nbsp; I had, indeed, begun the task, and had
failed; I had begun it a second time, and failing again, had
abandoned my attempt with a sensation of utter distaste.&nbsp; I
was unable to speak out, and chiefly, I think, for this reason,
that I knew not to whom I was speaking.&nbsp; It might be you, or
perhaps our Lady of Bitterness, <a name="citationxxxv"></a><a
href="#footnotexxxv" class="citation">[xxxv]</a> who would read
my story, or it might be some member of the Royal <a
name="pagexxxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxvi</span>Statistical Society, and how on earth was I to write
in a way that would do for all three?</p>
<p>Well, your request for a sketch of my tour suggested to me the
idea of complying with your wish by a revival of my
twice-abandoned attempt.&nbsp; I tried; and the pleasure and
confidence which I felt in speaking to you soon made my task so
easy, and even amusing, that after a while (though not in time
for your tour) I completed the scrawl from which this book was
originally printed.</p>
<p>The very feeling, however, which enabled me to write thus
freely, prevented me from robing my thoughts in that grave and
decorous style which I should have maintained if I had professed
to lecture the public.&nbsp; Whilst I feigned to myself that you,
and you only, were listening, I could not by any possibility
speak very solemnly.&nbsp; Heaven forbid that I should talk to my
own genial friend as though he were a great and enlightened
community, or any other respectable aggregate!</p>
<p>Yet I well understood that the mere fact of my professing to
speak to you rather than to the public generally could not
perfectly excuse me for printing a narrative too roughly worded,
and accordingly, in revising the proof-sheets, I have struck out
those phrases which seemed to be less fit for a published volume
than for intimate conversation.&nbsp; It is hardly to be
expected, however, that correction of this kind should be
perfectly complete, or that the almost boisterous tone in which
many parts of the book were originally written should be
thoroughly subdued.&nbsp; I venture, therefore, to ask, that the
familiarity of language still possibly apparent in the work may
be laid to the account of our delightful intimacy, rather than to
any presumptuous motive.&nbsp; I feel, as you know, much too
timidly, too distantly, and too <a name="pagexxxvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxvii</span>respectfully toward the public to
be capable of seeking to put myself on terms of easy fellowship
with strange and casual readers.</p>
<p>It is right to forewarn people (and I have tried to do this as
well as I can, by my studiously unpromising title-page) <a
name="citationxxxvii"></a><a href="#footnotexxxvii"
class="citation">[xxxvii]</a> that the book is quite superficial
in its character.&nbsp; I have endeavoured to discard from it all
valuable matter derived from the works of others, and it appears
to me that my efforts in this direction have been attended with
great success.&nbsp; I believe I may truly acknowledge that from
all details of geographical discovery, or antiquarian
research&mdash;from all display of &ldquo;sound learning and
religious knowledge&rdquo;&mdash;from all historical and
scientific illustrations&mdash;from all useful
statistics&mdash;from all political disquisitions&mdash;and from
all good moral reflections, the volume is thoroughly free.</p>
<p>My excuse for the book is its truth.&nbsp; You and I know a
man fond of hazarding elaborate jokes, who, whenever a story of
his happens not to go down as wit, will evade the awkwardness of
the failure by bravely maintaining that all he has said is pure
fact.&nbsp; I can honestly take this decent though humble mode of
escape.&nbsp; My narrative is not merely righteously exact in
matters of fact (where fact is in question), but it is true in
this larger sense&mdash;it conveys, not those impressions which
<i>ought to have been</i> produced upon any
&ldquo;well-constituted mind,&rdquo; but those which were really
and truly received at the time of his rambles by a headstrong and
not very amiable traveller, whose prejudices in favour of other
people&rsquo;s notions were then exceedingly slight.&nbsp; As I
have <a name="pagexxxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxviii</span>felt, so I have written; and the result is, that
there will often be found in my narrative a jarring discord
between the associations properly belonging to interesting sites,
and the tone in which I speak of them.&nbsp; This seemingly
perverse mode of treating the subject is forced upon me by my
plan of adhering to sentimental truth, and really does not result
from any impertinent wish to tease or trifle with readers.&nbsp;
I ought, for instance, to have felt as strongly in Jud&aelig;a as
in Galilee, but it was not so in fact.&nbsp; The religious
sentiment (born in solitude) which had heated my brain in the
sanctuary of Nazareth was rudely chilled at the foot of Zion by
disenchanting scenes, and this change is accordingly disclosed by
the perfectly worldly tone in which I speak of Jerusalem and
Bethlehem.</p>
<p>My notion of dwelling precisely upon those matters which
happened to interest me, and upon none other, would of course be
intolerable in a regular book of travels.&nbsp; If I had been
passing through countries not previously explored, it would have
been sadly perverse to withhold careful descriptions of admirable
objects merely because my own feelings of interest in them may
have happened to flag; but where the countries which one visits
have been thoroughly and ably described, and even artistically
illustrated by others, one is fully at liberty to say as little
(though not quite so much) as one chooses.&nbsp; Now a traveller
is a creature not always looking at sights; he remembers (how
often!) the happy land of his birth; he has, too, his moments of
humble enthusiasm about fire and food, about shade and drink; and
if he gives to these feelings anything like the prominence which
really belonged to them at the time of his travelling, he will
not seem a very good teacher.&nbsp; Once having determined to
write the sheer truth concerning the things which chiefly have <a
name="pagexxxix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxix</span>interested him, he must, and he will, sing a sadly
long strain about self; he will talk for whole pages together
about his bivouac fire, and ruin the ruins of Baalbec with eight
or ten cold lines.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that this egotism of a traveller, however
incessant, however shameless and obtrusive, must still convey
some true ideas of the country through which he has passed.&nbsp;
His very selfishness, his habit of referring the whole external
world to his own sensations, compels him, as it were, in his
writings to observe the laws of perspective;&mdash;he tells you
of objects, not as he knows them to be, but as they seemed to
him.&nbsp; The people and the things that most concern him
personally, however mean and insignificant, take large
proportions in his picture, because they stand so near to
him.&nbsp; He shows you his dragoman, and the gaunt features of
his Arabs&mdash;his tent, his kneeling camels, his baggage
strewed upon the sand; but the proper wonders of the
land&mdash;the cities, the mighty ruins and monuments of bygone
ages, he throws back faintly in the distance.&nbsp; It is thus
that he felt, and thus he strives to repeat the scenes of the
Elder World.&nbsp; You may listen to him for ever without
learning much in the way of statistics; but, perhaps, if you bear
with him long enough, you may find yourself slowly and faintly
impressed with the realities of Eastern travel.</p>
<p>My scheme of refusing to dwell upon matters which failed to
interest my own feelings has been departed from in one
instance&mdash;namely, in my detail of the late Lady Hester
Stanhope&rsquo;s conversation on supernatural topics.&nbsp; The
truth is, that I have been much questioned on this subject, and I
thought that my best plan would be to write down at once all that
I could ever have to say concerning the personage whose career
has excited so much curiosity amongst <a name="pagexl"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xl</span>Englishwomen.&nbsp; The result is,
that my account of the lady goes to a length which is not
justified either by the importance of the subject, or by the
extent to which it interested the narrator.</p>
<p>You will see that I constantly speak of &ldquo;my
People,&rdquo; &ldquo;my Party,&rdquo; &ldquo;my Arabs,&rdquo;
and so on, using terms which might possibly seem to imply that I
moved about with a pompous retinue.&nbsp; This of course was not
the case.&nbsp; I travelled with the simplicity proper to my
station, as one of the industrious class, who was not flying from
his country because of ennui, but was strengthening his will, and
tempering the metal of his nature, for that life of toil and
conflict in which he is now engaged.&nbsp; But an Englishman
journeying in the East must necessarily have with him dragomen
capable of interpreting the Oriental languages; the absence of
wheeled carriages obliges him to use several beasts of burthen
for his baggage, as well as for himself and his attendants; the
owners of the horses, or camels, with <i>their</i> slaves or
servants, fall in as part of his train; and altogether, the
cavalcade becomes rather numerous, without, however, occasioning
any proportionate increase of expense.&nbsp; When a traveller
speaks of all these followers in mass, he calls them his
&ldquo;people,&rdquo; or his &ldquo;troop,&rdquo; or his
&ldquo;party,&rdquo; without intending to make you believe that
he is therefore a Sovereign Prince.</p>
<p>You will see that I sometimes follow the custom of the Scots
in describing my fellow-countrymen by the names of their paternal
homes.</p>
<p>Of course all these explanations are meant for casual
readers.&nbsp; To you, without one syllable of excuse or
deprecation, and in all the confidence of a friendship that never
yet was clouded, I give the long-promised volume, and add but
this one &ldquo;Goodbye!&rdquo; for I dare not stand greeting you
here.</p>
<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OVER THE BORDER</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Semlin I still was encompassed
by the scenes and the sounds of familiar life; the din of a busy
world still vexed and cheered me; the unveiled faces of women
still shone in the light of day.&nbsp; Yet, whenever I chose to
look southward, I saw the Ottoman&rsquo;s fortress&mdash;austere,
and darkly impending high over the vale of the
Danube&mdash;historic Belgrade.&nbsp; I had come, as it were, to
the end of this wheel-going Europe, and now my eyes would see the
splendour and havoc of the East.</p>
<p>The two frontier towns are less than a cannon-shot distant,
and yet their people hold no communion. <a
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a>&nbsp; The Hungarian on the north, and
the Turk and Servian on the southern side of the Save are as much
asunder as though there were fifty broad provinces that lay in
the path between them.&nbsp; Of the men <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>that bustled around me in the streets
of Semlin there was not, perhaps, one who had ever gone down to
look upon the stranger race dwelling under the walls of that
opposite castle.&nbsp; It is the plague, and the dread of the
plague, that divide the one people from the other.&nbsp; All
coming and going stands forbidden by the terrors of the yellow
flag.&nbsp; If you dare to break the laws of the quarantine, you
will be tried with military haste; the court will scream out your
sentence to you from a tribunal some fifty yards off; the priest,
instead of gently whispering to you the sweet hopes of religion,
will console you at duelling distance; and after that you will
find yourself carefully shot, and carelessly buried in the ground
of the lazaretto.</p>
<p>When all was in order for our departure we walked down to the
precincts of the quarantine establishment, and here awaited us a
&ldquo;compromised&rdquo; <a name="citation2"></a><a
href="#footnote2" class="citation">[2]</a> officer of the
Austrian Government, who lives in a state of perpetual
excommunication.&nbsp; The boats, with their
&ldquo;compromised&rdquo; rowers, were also in readiness.</p>
<p>After coming in contact with any creature or thing belonging
to the Ottoman Empire it would be impossible for us to return to
the Austrian territory without undergoing an imprisonment of
fourteen days in the odious lazaretto.&nbsp; We felt, therefore,
that before we committed ourselves it was important to take care
that none of the arrangements necessary for <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>the journey had
been forgotten; and in our anxiety to avoid such a misfortune, we
managed the work of departure from Semlin with nearly as much
solemnity as if we had been departing this life.&nbsp; Some
obliging persons, from whom we had received civilities during our
short stay in the place, came down to say their farewell at the
river&rsquo;s side; and now, as we stood with them at the
distance of three or four yards from the
&ldquo;compromised&rdquo; officer, they asked if we were
perfectly certain that we had wound up all our affairs in
Christendom, and whether we had no parting requests to
make.&nbsp; We repeated the caution to our servants, and took
anxious thought lest by any possibility we might be cut off from
some cherished object of affection:&mdash;were they quite sure
that nothing had been forgotten&mdash;that there was no fragrant
dressing-case with its gold-compelling letters of credit from
which we might be parting for ever?&mdash;No; all our treasures
lay safely stowed in the boat, and we were ready to follow them
to the ends of the earth.&nbsp; Now, therefore, we shook hands
with our Semlin friends, who immediately retreated for three or
four paces, so as to leave us in the centre of a space between
them and the &ldquo;compromised&rdquo; officer.&nbsp; The latter
then advanced, and asking once more if we had done with the
civilised world, held forth his hand.&nbsp; I met it with mine,
and there was an end to Christendom for many a day to come.</p>
<p>We soon neared the southern bank of the river, but no sounds
came down from the blank walls above, and there was no living
thing that we could yet see, except one great hovering bird of
the vulture race, flying low, and intent, and wheeling round and
round over the pest-accursed city.</p>
<p>But presently there issued from the postern a group <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>of human
beings&mdash;beings with immortal souls, and possibly some
reasoning faculties; but to me the grand point was this, that
they had real, substantial, and incontrovertible turbans.&nbsp;
They made for the point towards which we were steering, and when
at last I sprang upon the shore, I heard, and saw myself now
first surrounded by men of Asiatic blood.&nbsp; I have since
ridden through the land of the Osmanlees, from the Servian border
to the Golden Horn&mdash;from the Gulf of Satalieh to the tomb of
Achilles; but never have I seen such ultra-Turkish looking
fellows as those who received me on the banks of the Save.&nbsp;
They were men in the humblest order of life, having come to meet
our boat in the hope of earning something by carrying our luggage
up to the city; but poor though they were, it was plain that they
were Turks of the proud old school, and had not yet forgotten the
fierce, careless bearing of their once victorious race.</p>
<p>Though the province of Servia generally has obtained a kind of
independence, yet Belgrade, as being a place of strength on the
frontier, is still garrisoned by Turkish troops under the command
of a Pasha.&nbsp; Whether the fellows who now surrounded us were
soldiers, or peaceful inhabitants, I did not understand: they
wore the old Turkish costume; vests and jackets of many and
brilliant colours, divided from the loose petticoat-trousers by
heavy volumes of shawl, so thickly folded around their waists as
to give the meagre wearers something of the dignity of true
corpulence.&nbsp; This cincture enclosed a whole bundle of
weapons; no man bore less than one brace of immensely long
pistols, and a yataghan (or cutlass), with a dagger or two of
various shapes and sizes; most of these arms were <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>inlaid with
silver, and highly burnished, so that they contrasted shiningly
with the decayed grandeur of the garments to which they were
attached (this carefulness of his arms is a point of honour with
the Osmanlee, who never allows his bright yataghan to suffer from
his own adversity); then the long drooping mustachios, and the
ample folds of the once white turbans, that lowered over the
piercing eyes, and the haggard features of the men, gave them an
air of gloomy pride, and that appearance of trying to be
disdainful under difficulties, which I have since seen so often
in those of the Ottoman people who live, and remember old times;
they seemed as if they were thinking that they would have been
more usefully, more honourably, and more piously employed in
cutting our throats than in carrying our portmanteaus.&nbsp; The
faithful Steel (Methley&rsquo;s Yorkshire servant) stood aghast
for a moment at the sight of his master&rsquo;s luggage upon the
shoulders of these warlike porters, and when at last we began to
move up he could scarcely avoid turning round to cast one
affectionate look towards Christendom, but quickly again he
marched on with steps of a man, not frightened exactly, but
sternly prepared for death, or the Koran, or even for plural
wives.</p>
<p>The Moslem quarter of a city is lonely and desolate.&nbsp; You
go up and down, and on over shelving and hillocky paths through
the narrow lanes walled in by blank, windowless dwellings; you
come out upon an open space strewed with the black ruins that
some late fire has left; you pass by a mountain of castaway
things, the rubbish of centuries, and on it you see numbers of
big, wolflike dogs lying torpid under the sun, with limbs <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>out-stretched
to the full, as if they were dead; storks, or cranes, sitting
fearless upon the low roofs, look gravely down upon you; the
still air that you breathe is loaded with the scent of citron,
and pomegranate rinds scorched by the sun, or (as you approach
the bazaar) with the dry, dead perfume of strange spices.&nbsp;
You long for some signs of life, and tread the ground more
heavily, as though you would wake the sleepers with the heel of
your boot; but the foot falls noiseless upon the crumbling soil
of an Eastern city, and silence follows you still.&nbsp; Again
and again you meet turbans, and faces of men, but they have
nothing for you&mdash;no welcome&mdash;no wonder&mdash;no
wrath&mdash;no scorn&mdash;they look upon you as we do upon a
December&rsquo;s fall of snow&mdash;as a
&ldquo;seasonable,&rdquo; unaccountable, uncomfortable work of
God, that may have been sent for some good purpose, to be
revealed hereafter.</p>
<p>Some people had come down to meet us with an invitation from
the Pasha, and we wound our way up to the castle.&nbsp; At the
gates there were groups of soldiers, some smoking, and some lying
flat like corpses upon the cool stones.&nbsp; We went through
courts, ascended steps, passed along a corridor, and walked into
an airy, whitewashed room, with an European clock at one end of
it, and Moostapha Pasha at the other; the fine, old, bearded
potentate looked very like Jove&mdash;like Jove, too, in the
midst of his clouds, for the silvery fumes of the <i>narghile</i>
<a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a> hung lightly circling round him.</p>
<p>The Pasha received us with the smooth, kind, <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>gentle manner
that belongs to well-bred Osmanlees; then he lightly clapped his
hands, and instantly the sound filled all the lower end of the
room with slaves; a syllable dropped from his lips which bowed
all heads, and conjured away the attendants like ghosts (their
coming and their going was thus swift and quiet, because their
feet were bare, and they passed through no door, but only by the
yielding folds of a purder).&nbsp; Soon the coffee-bearers
appeared, every man carrying separately his tiny cup in a small
metal stand; and presently to each of us there came a
pipe-bearer, who first rested the bowl of the <i>tchibouque</i>
at a measured distance on the floor, and then, on this axis,
wheeled round the long cheery stick, and gracefully presented it
on half-bended knee; already the well-kindled fire was glowing
secure in the bowl, and so, when I pressed the amber lip <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a> to mine, there was no coyness to
conquer; the willing fume came up, and answered my slightest
sigh, and followed softly every breath inspired, till it touched
me with some faint sense and understanding of Asiatic
contentment.</p>
<p>Asiatic contentment!&nbsp; Yet scarcely, perhaps, one hour
before I had been wanting my bill, and ringing for waiters, in a
shrill and busy hotel.</p>
<p>In the Ottoman dominions there is scarcely any hereditary
influence except that which belongs to the family of the Sultan;
and wealth, too, is a highly volatile blessing, not easily
transmitted to the descendant of the owner.&nbsp; From these
causes it results that the people standing in the place of nobles
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and gentry
are official personages, and though many (indeed the greater
number) of these potentates are humbly born and bred, you will
seldom, I think, find them wanting in that polished smoothness of
manner, and those well-undulating tones which belong to the best
Osmanlees.&nbsp; The truth is, that most of the men in authority
have risen from their humble station by the arts of the courtier,
and they preserve in their high estate those gentle powers of
fascination to which they owe their success.&nbsp; Yet unless you
can contrive to learn a little of the language, you will be
rather bored by your visits of ceremony; the intervention of the
interpreter, or dragoman as he is called, is fatal to the spirit
of conversation.&nbsp; I think I should mislead you if I were to
attempt to give the substance of any particular conversation with
Orientals.&nbsp; A traveller may write and say that &ldquo;the
Pasha of So-and-so was particularly interested in the vast
progress which has been made in the application of steam, and
appeared to understand the structure of our machinery&mdash;that
he remarked upon the gigantic results of our manufacturing
industry&mdash;showed that he possessed considerable knowledge of
our Indian affairs, and of the constitution of the Company, and
expressed a lively admiration of the many sterling qualities for
which the people of England are distinguished.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
the heap of commonplaces thus quietly attributed to the Pasha
will have been founded perhaps on some such talking as
this:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Pasha</i>.&mdash;The Englishman is welcome; most blessed
among hours is this, the hour of his coming.</p>
<p><i>Dragoman</i> (to the traveller).&mdash;The Pasha pays you
his compliments.</p>
<p><i>Traveller</i>.&mdash;Give him my best compliments in <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>return, and say
I&rsquo;m delighted to have the honour of seeing him.</p>
<p><i>Dragoman</i> (to the Pasha).&mdash;His lordship, this
Englishman, Lord of London, Scorner of Ireland, Suppressor of
France, has quitted his governments, and left his enemies to
breathe for a moment, and has crossed the broad waters in strict
disguise, with a small but eternally faithful retinue of
followers, in order that he might look upon the bright
countenance of the Pasha among Pashas&mdash;the Pasha of the
everlasting Pashalik of Karagholookoldour.</p>
<p><i>Traveller</i> (to his dragoman).&mdash;What on earth have
you been saying about London?&nbsp; The Pasha will be taking me
for a mere cockney.&nbsp; Have not I told you <i>always</i> to
say that I am from a branch of the family of Mudcombe Park, and
that I am to be a magistrate for the county of Bedfordshire, only
I&rsquo;ve not qualified, and that I should have been a
deputy-lieutenant if it had not been for the extraordinary
conduct of Lord Mountpromise, and that I was a candidate for
Goldborough at the last election, and that I should have won easy
if my committee had not been bought.&nbsp; I wish to Heaven that
if you <i>do</i> say anything about me, you&rsquo;d tell the
simple truth.</p>
<p><i>Dragoman</i> [is silent].</p>
<p><i>Pasha</i>.&mdash;What says the friendly Lord of London? is
there aught that I can grant him within the Pashalik of
Karagholookoldour?</p>
<p><i>Dragoman</i> (growing sulky and literal).&mdash;This
friendly Englishman&mdash;this branch of Mudcombe&mdash;this
head-purveyor of Goldborough&mdash;this possible policeman of
Bedfordshire, is recounting his achievements, and the number of
his titles.</p>
<p><i>Pasha</i>.&mdash;The end of his honours is more distant
than the ends of the earth, and the catalogue of <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>his glorious
deeds is brighter than the firmament of heaven!</p>
<p><i>Dragoman</i> (to the traveller).&mdash;The Pasha
congratulates your Excellency.</p>
<p><i>Traveller</i>.&mdash;About Goldborough?&nbsp; The deuce he
does!&mdash;but I want to get at his views in relation to the
present state of the Ottoman Empire.&nbsp; Tell him the Houses of
Parliament have met, and that there has been a speech from the
throne, pledging England to preserve the integrity of the
Sultan&rsquo;s dominions.</p>
<p><i>Dragoman</i> (to the Pasha).&mdash;This branch of Mudcombe,
this possible policeman of Bedfordshire, informs your Highness
that in England the talking houses have met, and that the
integrity of the Sultan&rsquo;s dominions has been assured for
ever and ever by a speech from the velvet chair.</p>
<p><i>Pasha</i>.&mdash;Wonderful chair!&nbsp; Wonderful
houses!&mdash;whirr! whirr! all by wheels!&mdash;whiz! whiz! all
by steam!&mdash;wonderful chair! wonderful houses! wonderful
people!&mdash;whirr! whirr! all by wheels!&mdash;whiz! whiz! all
by steam!</p>
<p><i>Traveller</i> (to the dragoman).&mdash;What does the Pasha
mean by that whizzing? he does not mean to say, does he, that our
Government will ever abandon their pledges to the Sultan?</p>
<p><i>Dragoman</i>.&mdash;No, your Excellency; but he says the
English talk by wheels, and by steam.</p>
<p><i>Traveller</i>.&mdash;That&rsquo;s an exaggeration; but say
that the English really have carried machinery to great
perfection; tell the Pasha (he&rsquo;ll be struck with that) that
whenever we have any disturbances to put down, even at two or
three hundred miles from London, we can send troops by the
thousand to the scene of action in a few hours.</p>
<p><i>Dragoman</i> (recovering his temper and freedom of <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>speech).&mdash;His Excellency, this Lord of Mudcombe,
observes to your Highness, that whenever the Irish, or the
French, or the Indians rebel against the English, whole armies of
soldiers, and brigades of artillery, are dropped into a mighty
chasm called Euston Square, and in the biting of a cartridge they
arise up again in Manchester, or Dublin, or Paris, or Delhi, and
utterly exterminate the enemies of England from the face of the
earth.</p>
<p><i>Pasha</i>.&mdash;I know it&mdash;I know all&mdash;the
particulars have been faithfully related to me, and my mind
comprehends locomotives.&nbsp; The armies of the English ride
upon the vapours of boiling caldrons, and their horses are
flaming coals!&mdash;whirr! whirr! all by wheels!&mdash;whiz!
whiz! all by steam!</p>
<p><i>Traveller</i> (to his dragoman).&mdash;I wish to have the
opinion of an unprejudiced Ottoman gentleman as to the prospects
of our English commerce and manufactures; just ask the Pasha to
give me his views on the subject.</p>
<p><i>Pasha</i> (after having received the communication of the
dragoman).&mdash;The ships of the English swarm like flies; their
printed calicoes cover the whole earth; and by the side of their
swords the blades of Damascus are blades of grass.&nbsp; All
India is but an item in the ledger-books of the merchants, whose
lumber-rooms are filled with ancient thrones!&mdash;whirr! whirr!
all by wheels!&mdash;whiz! whiz! all by steam!</p>
<p><i>Dragoman</i>.&mdash;The Pasha compliments the cutlery of
England, and also the East India Company.</p>
<p><i>Traveller</i>.&mdash;The Pasha&rsquo;s right about the
cutlery (I tried my scimitar with the common officers&rsquo;
swords belonging to our fellows at Malta, and they cut it like
the leaf of a novel).&nbsp; Well (to the <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>dragoman),
tell the Pasha I am exceedingly gratified to find that he
entertains such a high opinion of our manufacturing energy, but I
should like him to know, though, that we have got something in
England besides that.&nbsp; These foreigners are always fancying
that we have nothing but ships, and railways, and East India
Companies; do just tell the Pasha that our rural districts
deserve his attention, and that even within the last two hundred
years there has been an evident improvement in the culture of the
turnip, and if he does not take any interest about that, at all
events you can explain that we have our virtues in the
country&mdash;that we are a truth-telling people, and, like the
Osmanlees, are faithful in the performance of our promises.&nbsp;
Oh! and, by the bye, whilst you are about it, you may as well
just say at the end that the British yeoman is still, thank God!
the British yeoman.</p>
<p><i>Pasha</i> (after hearing the dragoman).&mdash;It is true,
it is true:&mdash;through all Feringhistan the English are
foremost and best; for the Russians are drilled swine, and the
Germans are sleeping babes, and the Italians are the servants of
songs, and the French are the sons of newspapers, and the Greeks
they are weavers of lies, but the English and the Osmanlees are
brothers together in righteousness; for the Osmanlees believe in
one only God, and cleave to the Koran, and destroy idols; so do
the English worship one God, and abominate graven images, and
tell the truth, and believe in a book, and though they drink the
juice of the grape, yet to say that they worship their prophet as
God, or to say that they are eaters of pork, these are
lies&mdash;lies born of Greeks, and nursed by Jews!</p>
<p><i>Dragoman</i>.&mdash;The Pasha compliments the English.</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span><i>Traveller</i> (rising).&mdash;Well, I&rsquo;ve had
enough of this.&nbsp; Tell the Pasha I am greatly obliged to him
for his hospitality, and still more for his kindness in
furnishing me with horses, and say that now I must be off.</p>
<p><i>Pasha</i> (after hearing the dragoman, and standing up on
his divan). <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a>&mdash;Proud are the sires, and blessed
are the dams of the horses that shall carry his Excellency to the
end of his prosperous journey.&nbsp; May the saddle beneath him
glide down to the gates of the happy city, like a boat swimming
on the third river of Paradise.&nbsp; May he sleep the sleep of a
child, when his friends are around him; and the while that his
enemies are abroad, may his eyes flame red through the
darkness&mdash;more red than the eyes of ten tigers!&nbsp;
Farewell!</p>
<p><i>Dragoman</i>.&mdash;The Pasha wishes your Excellency a
pleasant journey.</p>
<p>So ends the visit.</p>

14</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TURKISH TRAVELLING</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> two or three hours our party was
ready; the servants, the Tatar, the mounted Suridgees, <a
name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a> and the baggage-horses, altogether
made up a strong cavalcade.&nbsp; The accomplished Mysseri, <a
name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a> of whom you have heard me speak so
often, and who served me so faithfully throughout my Oriental
journeys, acted as our interpreter, and was, in fact, the brain
of our corps.&nbsp; The Tatar, you know, is a Government courier
properly employed in carrying despatches, but also sent with
travellers to speed them on their way, and answer with his head
for their safety.&nbsp; The man whose head was thus pledged for
our precious lives was a glorious-looking fellow, with the
regular and handsome cast of countenance which is now
characteristic of the Ottoman race. <a name="citation14c"></a><a
href="#footnote14c" class="citation">[14c]</a>&nbsp; His features
displayed <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>a good deal of serene pride, self-respect, fortitude, a
kind of ingenuous sensuality, and something of instinctive
wisdom, without any sharpness of intellect.&nbsp; He had been a
Janissary (as I afterwards found), and kept up the odd strut of
his old corps, which used to affright the Christians in former
times&mdash;that rolling gait so comically pompous, that a close
imitation of it, even in the broadest farce, would be looked upon
as a very rough over-acting of the character.&nbsp; It is
occasioned in part by dress and accoutrements.&nbsp; The weighty
bundle of weapons carried upon the chest throws back the body so
as to give it a wonderful portliness, and, moreover, the immense
masses of clothes that swathe his limbs force the wearer in
walking to swing himself heavily round from left to right, and
from right to left.&nbsp; In truth, this great edifice of
woollen, and cotton, and silk, and silver, and brass, and steel
is not at all fitted for moving on foot; it cannot even walk
without frightfully discomposing its fair proportions; and as to
running&mdash;our Tatar ran <i>once</i> (it was in order to pick
up a partridge that Methley had winged with a pistol-shot), and
really the attempt was one of the funniest misdirections of human
energy that wondering man ever saw.&nbsp; But put him in his
stirrups, and then is the Tatar himself again: there he lives at
his pleasure, reposing in the tranquillity of that true home (the
home of his ancestors) which the saddle seems to afford him, and
drawing from his pipe the calm pleasures of his &ldquo;own
fireside,&rdquo; or else dashing sudden over the earth, as though
for a moment he felt the mouth of a Turcoman steed, and saw his
own Scythian plains lying boundless and open before him.</p>
<p>It was not till his subordinates had nearly completed their
preparations for their march that our <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Tatar, &ldquo;commanding the
forces,&rdquo; arrived; he came sleek and fresh from the bath
(for so is the custom of the Ottomans when they start upon a
journey), and was carefully accoutred at every point.&nbsp; From
his thigh to his throat he was loaded with arms and other
implements of a campaigning life.&nbsp; There is no scarcity of
water along the whole road from Belgrade to Stamboul, but the
habits of our Tatar were formed by his ancestors and not by
himself, so he took good care to see that his leathern
water-flask was amply charged and properly strapped to the
saddle, along with his blessed <i>tchibouque</i>.&nbsp; And now
at last he has cursed the Suridgees in all proper figures of
speech, and is ready for a ride of a thousand miles; but before
he comforts his soul in the marble baths of Stamboul he will be
another and a lesser man; his sense of responsibility, his too
strict abstemiousness, and his restless energy, disdainful of
sleep, will have worn him down to a fraction of the sleek
Moostapha that now leads out our party from the gates of
Belgrade.</p>
<p>The Suridgees are the men employed to lead the
baggage-horses.&nbsp; They are most of them gipsies.&nbsp; Their
lot is a sad one: they are the last of the human race, and all
the sins of their superiors (including the horses) can safely be
visited on them.&nbsp; But the wretched look often more
picturesque than their betters; and though all the world despise
these poor Suridgees, their tawny skins and their grisly beards
will gain them honourable standing in the foreground of a
landscape.&nbsp; We had a couple of these fellows with us, each
leading a baggage-horse, to the tail of which last another
baggage-horse was attached.&nbsp; There was a world of trouble in
persuading the stiff angular portmanteaus of Europe to adapt
themselves <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>to their new condition and sit quietly on pack-saddles,
but all was right at last, and it gladdened my eyes to see our
little troop file off through the winding lanes of the city, and
show down brightly in the plain beneath.&nbsp; The one of our
party that seemed to be most out of keeping with the rest of the
scene was Methley&rsquo;s Yorkshire servant, who always rode
doggedly on in his pantry jacket, looking out for
&ldquo;gentlemen&rsquo;s seats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Methley and I had English saddles, but I think we should have
done just as well (I should certainly have seen more of the
country) if we had adopted saddles like that of our Tatar, who
towered so loftily over the scraggy little beast that carried
him.&nbsp; In taking thought for the East, whilst in England, I
had made one capital hit which you must not forget&mdash;I had
brought with me a pair of common spurs.&nbsp; These were a great
comfort to me throughout my horseback travels, by keeping up the
cheerfulness of the many unhappy nags that I had to bestride; the
angle of the Oriental stirrup is a very poor substitute for
spurs.</p>
<p>The Ottoman horseman, raised by his saddle to a great height
above the humble level of the back that he bestrides, and using
an awfully sharp bit, is able to lift the crest of his nag, and
force him into a strangely fast shuffling walk, the orthodox pace
for the journey.&nbsp; My comrade and I, using English saddles,
could not easily keep our beasts up to this peculiar amble;
besides, we thought it a bore to be <i>followed</i> by our
attendants for a thousand miles, and we generally, therefore, did
duty as the rearguard of our &ldquo;grand army&rdquo;; we used to
walk our horses till the party in front had got into the
distance, and then retrieve the lost ground by a gallop.</p>
<p>We had ridden on for some two or three hours; <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the stir and
bustle of our commencing journey had ceased, the liveliness of
our little troop had worn off with the declining day, and the
night closed in as we entered the great Servian forest.&nbsp;
Through this our road was to last for more than a hundred
miles.&nbsp; Endless, and endless now on either side, the tall
oaks closed in their ranks and stood gloomily lowering over us,
as grim as an army of giants with a thousand years&rsquo; pay in
arrear.&nbsp; One strived with listening ear to catch some
tidings of that forest world within&mdash;some stirring of
beasts, some night-bird&rsquo;s scream, but all was quite hushed,
except the voice of the cicalas that peopled every bough, and
filled the depths of the forest through and through, with one
same hum everlasting&mdash;more stilling than very silence.</p>
<p>At first our way was in darkness, but after a while the moon
got up, and touched the glittering arms and tawny faces of our
men with light so pale and mystic, that the watchful Tatar felt
bound to look out for demons, and take proper means for keeping
them off; forthwith he determined that the duty of frightening
away our ghostly enemies (like every other troublesome work)
should fall upon the poor Suridgees, who accordingly lifted up
their voices, and burst upon the dreadful stillness of the forest
with shrieks and dismal howls.&nbsp; These precautions were kept
up incessantly, and were followed by the most complete success,
for not one demon came near us.</p>
<p>Long before midnight we reached the hamlet in which we were to
rest for the night; it was made up of about a dozen clay huts,
standing upon a small tract of ground hardly won from the
forest.&nbsp; The peasants that lived there spoke a Slavonic
dialect, and Mysseri&rsquo;s knowledge of the Russian tongue
enabled him to talk with them freely.&nbsp; We took up our <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>quarters in a
square room with white walls and an earthen floor, quite bare of
furniture, and utterly void of women.&nbsp; They told us,
however, that these Servian villagers lived in happy abundance,
but that they were careful to conceal their riches, as well as
their wives.</p>
<p>The burthens unstrapped from the pack-saddles very quickly
furnished our den; a couple of quilts spread upon the floor, with
a carpet-bag at the head of each, became capital
sofas&mdash;portmanteaus, and hat-boxes, and writing-cases, and
books, and maps, and gleaming arms soon lay strewed around us in
pleasant confusion.&nbsp; Mysseri&rsquo;s canteen too began to
yield up its treasures, but we relied upon finding some
provisions in the village.&nbsp; At first the natives declared
that their hens were mere old maids and all their cows unmarried;
but our Tatar swore such a grand sonorous oath, and fingered the
hilt of his yataghan with such persuasive touch, that the land
soon flowed with milk, and mountains of eggs arose.</p>
<p>And soon there was tea before us, with all its unspeakable
fragrance, and as we reclined on the floor, we found that a
portmanteau was just the right height for a table; the duty of
candlesticks was ably performed by a couple of intelligent
natives; the rest of the villagers stood by the open doorway at
the lower end of the room, and watched our banqueting with grave
and devout attention.</p>
<p>The first night of your first campaign (though you be but a
mere peaceful campaigner) is a glorious time in your life.&nbsp;
It is so sweet to find one&rsquo;s self free from the stale
civilisation of Europe!&nbsp; Oh, my dear ally, when first you
spread your carpet in the midst of these Eastern scenes, do think
for a moment of those your fellow-creatures, that dwell in
squares, <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>and streets, and even (for such is the fate of many!) in
actual country houses; think of the people that are
&ldquo;presenting their compliments,&rdquo; and &ldquo;requesting
the honour,&rdquo; and &ldquo;much regretting,&rdquo;&mdash;of
those that are pinioned at dinner-tables, or stuck up in
ballrooms, or cruelly planted in pews,&mdash;ay, think of these,
and so remembering how many poor devils are living in a state of
utter respectability, you will glory the more in your own
delightful escape.</p>
<p>I am bound to confess, however, that with all its charms a mud
floor (like a mercenary match) does certainly promote early
rising.&nbsp; Long before daybreak we were up, and had
breakfasted; after this there was nearly a whole tedious hour to
endure whilst the horses were laden by torchlight; but this had
an end, and at last we went on once more.&nbsp; Cloaked, and
sombre, at first we made our sullen way through the darkness,
with scarcely one barter of words; but soon the genial morn burst
down from heaven, and stirred the blood so gladly through our
veins, that the very Suridgees, with all their troubles, could
now look up for an instant, and almost seem to believe in the
temporary goodness of God.</p>
<p>The actual movement from one place to another, in Europeanised
countries, is a process so temporary&mdash;it occupies, I mean,
so small a proportion of the traveller&rsquo;s entire
time&mdash;that his mind remains unsettled, so long as the wheels
are going; he may be alive enough to external objects of
interest, and to the crowding ideas which are often invited by
the excitement of a changing scene, but he is still conscious of
being in a provisional state, and his mind is constantly
recurring to the expected end of his journey; his ordinary ways
of thought have been interrupted, and before any new mental
habits can be <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>formed he is quietly fixed in his hotel.&nbsp; It will
be otherwise with you when you journey in the East.&nbsp; Day
after day, perhaps week after week and month after month, your
foot is in the stirrup.&nbsp; To taste the cold breath of the
earliest morn, and to lead, or follow, your bright cavalcade till
sunset through forests and mountain passes, through valleys and
desolate plains, all this becomes your <span class="smcap">mode
of life</span>, and you ride, eat, drink, and curse the
mosquitoes as systematically as your friends in England eat,
drink, and sleep.&nbsp; If you are wise, you will not look upon
the long period of time thus occupied in actual movement as the
mere gulf dividing you from the end of your journey, but rather
as one of those rare and plastic seasons of your life from which,
perhaps, in after times you may love to date the moulding of your
character&mdash;that is, your very identity.&nbsp; Once feel
this, and you will soon grow happy and contented in your
saddle-home.&nbsp; As for me and my comrade, however, in this
part of our journey we often forgot Stamboul, forgot all the
Ottoman Empire, and only remembered old times.&nbsp; We went
back, loitering on the banks of Thames&mdash;not grim old Thames
of &ldquo;after life,&rdquo; that washes the Parliament Houses,
and drowns despairing girl&mdash;but Thames, the &ldquo;old Eton
fellow,&rdquo; that wrestled with us in our boyhood till he
taught us to be stronger than he.&nbsp; We bullied Keate, and
scoffed at Larry Miller, and Okes; we rode along loudly laughing,
and talked to the grave Servian forest as though it were the
&ldquo;Brocas clump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our pace was commonly very slow, for the baggage-horses served
us for a drag, and kept us to a rate of little more than five
miles in the hour, but now and then, and chiefly at night, a
spirit of movement <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>would suddenly animate the whole party; the
baggage-horses would be teased into a gallop, and when once this
was done, there would be such a banging of portmanteaus, and such
convulsions of carpet-bags upon their panting sides, and the
Suridgees would follow them up with such a hurricane of blows,
and screams, and curses, that stopping or relaxing was scarcely
possible; then the rest of us would put our horses into a gallop,
and so, all shouting cheerily, would hunt, and drive the sumpter
beasts like a flock of goats, up hill and down dale, right on to
the end of their journey.</p>
<p>The distances at which we got relays of horses varied greatly;
some were not more than fifteen or twenty miles, but twice, I
think, we performed a whole day&rsquo;s journey of more than
sixty miles with the same beasts.</p>
<p>When at last we came out from the forest our road lay through
scenes like those of an English park.&nbsp; The green sward
unfenced, and left to the free pasture of cattle, was dotted with
groups of stately trees, and here and there darkened over with
larger masses of wood, that seemed gathered together for bounding
the domain, and shutting out some &ldquo;infernal&rdquo;
fellow-creature in the shape of a newly made squire; in one or
two spots the hanging copses looked down upon a lawn below with
such sheltering mien, that seeing the like in England you would
have been tempted almost to ask the name of the spendthrift, or
the madman who had dared to pull down &ldquo;the old
hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are few countries less infested by &ldquo;lions&rdquo;
than the provinces on this part of your route.&nbsp; You are not
called upon to &ldquo;drop a tear&rdquo; over the tomb of
&ldquo;the once brilliant&rdquo; anybody, or to pay your <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;tribute of respect&rdquo; to anything dead or
alive.&nbsp; There are no Servian or Bulgarian litterateurs with
whom it would be positively disgraceful not to form an
acquaintance; you have no staring, no praising to get through;
the only public building of any interest that lies on the road is
of modern date, but is said to be a good specimen of Oriental
architecture; it is of a pyramidical shape, and is made up of
thirty thousand skulls, contributed by the rebellious Servians in
the early part (I believe) of this century: I am not at all sure
of my date, but I fancy it was in the year 1806 that the first
skull was laid. <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a>&nbsp; I am ashamed to say that in the
darkness of the early morning we unknowingly went by the
neighbourhood of this triumph of art, and so basely got off from
admiring &ldquo;the simple grandeur of the architect&rsquo;s
conception,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the exquisite beauty of the
fretwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There being no &ldquo;lions,&rdquo; we ought at least to have
met with a few perils, but the only robbers we saw anything of
had been long since dead and gone.&nbsp; The poor fellows had
been impaled upon high poles, and so propped up by the transverse
spokes beneath them, that their skeletons, clothed with some
white, <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>wax-like remains of flesh, still sat up lolling in the
sunshine, and listlessly stared without eyes.</p>
<p>One day it seemed to me that our path was a little more rugged
than usual, and I found that I was deserving for myself the title
of Sabalkansky, or &ldquo;Transcender of the Balcan.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The truth is, that, as a military barrier, the Balcan is a
fabulous mountain.&nbsp; Such seems to be the view of Major
Keppell, who looked on it towards the east with the eye of a
soldier, and certainly in the Sophia Pass, which I followed,
there is no narrow defile, and no ascent sufficiently difficult
to stop, or delay for long time, a train of siege artillery.</p>
<p>Before we reached Adrianople, Methley had been seized with we
knew not what ailment, and when we had taken up our quarters in
the city he was cast to the very earth by sickness.&nbsp;
Andrianople enjoyed an English consul, and I felt sure that, in
Eastern phrase, his house would cease to be his house, and would
become the house of my sick comrade.&nbsp; I should have judged
rightly under ordinary circumstances, but the levelling plague
was abroad, and the dread of it had dominion over the consular
mind.&nbsp; So now (whether dying or not, one could hardly tell),
upon a quilt stretched out along the floor, there lay the best
hope of an ancient line, without the material aids to comfort of
even the humblest sort, and (sad to say) without the consolation
of a friend, or even a comrade worth having.&nbsp; I have a
notion that tenderness and pity are affections occasioned in some
measure by living within doors; certainly, at the time I speak
of, the open-air life which I have been leading, or the wayfaring
hardships of the journey, had so strangely blunted me, that I
felt intolerant of illness, and looked down upon my companion as
if the poor fellow in <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>falling ill had betrayed a want of
spirit.&nbsp; I entertained, too, a most absurd idea&mdash;an
idea that his illness was partly affected.&nbsp; You see that I
have made a confession: this I hope&mdash;that I may always
hereafter look charitably upon the hard, savage acts of peasants,
and the cruelties of a &ldquo;brutal&rdquo; soldiery.&nbsp; God
knows that I strived to melt myself into common charity, and to
put on a gentleness which I could not feel, but this attempt did
not cheat the keenness of the sufferer; he could not have felt
the less deserted because that I was with him.</p>
<p>We called to aid a solemn Armenian (I think he was), half
soothsayer, half hakim or doctor, who, all the while counting his
beads, fixed his eyes steadily upon the patient, and then
suddenly dealt him a violent blow on the chest.&nbsp; Methley
bravely dissembled his pain, for he fancied that the blow was
meant to try whether or not the plague were on him.</p>
<p>Here was really a sad embarrassment&mdash;no bed; nothing to
offer the invalid in the shape of food save a piece of thin,
tough, flexible, drab-coloured cloth, made of flour and
mill-stones in equal proportions, and called by the name of
&ldquo;bread&rdquo;; then the patient, of course, had no
&ldquo;confidence in his medical man,&rdquo; and on the whole,
the best chance of saving my comrade seemed to lie in taking him
out of the reach of his doctor, and bearing him away to the
neighbourhood of some more genial consul.&nbsp; But how was this
to be done?&nbsp; Methley was much too ill to be kept in his
saddle, and wheel carriages, as means of travelling, were
unknown.&nbsp; There is, however, such a thing as an
&ldquo;araba,&rdquo; a vehicle drawn by oxen, in which the wives
of a rich man are sometimes dragged four or five miles over the
grass by <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>way of recreation.&nbsp; The carriage is rudely framed,
but you recognise in the simple grandeur of its design a likeness
to things majestic; in short, if your carpenter&rsquo;s son were
to make a &ldquo;Lord Mayor&rsquo;s coach&rdquo; for little Amy,
he would build a carriage very much in the style of a Turkish
araba.&nbsp; No one had ever heard of horses being used for
drawing a carriage in this part of the world, but necessity is
the mother of innovation as well as of invention.&nbsp; I was
fully justified, I think, in arguing that there were numerous
instances of horses being used for that purpose in our own
country&mdash;that the laws of nature are uniform in their
operation over all the world (except Ireland)&mdash;that that
which was true in Piccadilly, must be true in
Adrianople&mdash;that the matter could not fairly be treated as
an ecclesiastical question, for that the circumstance of
Methley&rsquo;s going on to Stamboul in an araba drawn by horses,
when calmly and dispassionately considered, would appear to be
perfectly consistent with the maintenance of the Mahometan
religion as by law established.&nbsp; Thus poor, dear, patient
Reason would have fought her slow battle against Asiatic
prejudice, and I am convinced that she would have established the
possibility (and perhaps even the propriety) of harnessing horses
in a hundred and fifty years; but in the meantime Mysseri, well
seconded by our Tatar, put a very quick end to the controversy by
having the horses put to.</p>
<p>It was a sore thing for me to see my poor comrade brought to
this, for young though he was, he was a veteran in travel.&nbsp;
When scarcely yet of age he had invaded India from the frontiers
of Russia, and that so swiftly, that measuring by the time of his
flight the broad dominions of the king of kings were <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>shrivelled up
to a dukedom, and now, poor fellow, he was to be poked into an
araba, like a Georgian girl!&nbsp; He suffered greatly, for there
were no springs for the carriage, and no road for the wheels; and
so the concern jolted on over the open country with such twists,
and jerks, and jumps, as might almost dislocate the supple tongue
of Satan.</p>
<p>All day the patient kept himself shut up within the
lattice-work of the araba, and I could hardly know how he was
faring until the end of the day&rsquo;s journey, when I found
that he was not worse, and was buoyed up with the hope of some
day reaching Constantinople.</p>
<p>I was always conning over my maps, and fancied that I knew
pretty well my line, but after Adrianople I had made more
southing than I knew for, and it was with unbelieving wonder, and
delight, that I came suddenly upon the shore of the sea.&nbsp; A
little while, and its gentle billows were flowing beneath the
hoofs of my beast; but the hearing of the ripple was not enough
communion, and the seeing of the blue Propontis was not to know
and possess it&mdash;I must needs plunge into its depth and
quench my longing love in the palpable waves; and so when old
Moostapha (defender against demons) looked round for his charge,
he saw with horror and dismay that he for whose life his own life
stood pledged was possessed of some devil who had driven him down
into the sea&mdash;that the rider and the steed had vanished from
earth, and that out among the waves was the gasping crest of a
post-horse, and the ghostly head of the Englishman moving upon
the face of the waters.</p>
<p>We started very early indeed on the last day of our journey,
and from the moment of being off until <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>we gained the shelter of the imperial
walls we were struggling face to face with an icy storm that
swept right down from the steppes of Tartary, keen, fierce, and
steady as a northern conqueror.&nbsp; Methley&rsquo;s servant,
who was the greatest sufferer, kept his saddle until we reached
Stamboul, but was then found to be quite benumbed in limbs, and
his brain was so much affected that when he was lifted from his
horse he fell away in a state of unconsciousness, the first stage
of a dangerous fever.</p>
<p>Our Tatar, worn down by care and toil, and carrying seven
heavens full of water in his manifold jackets and shawls, was a
mere weak and vapid dilution of the sleek Moostapha, who scarce
more than one fortnight before came out like a bridegroom from
his chamber to take the command of our party.</p>
<p>Mysseri seemed somewhat over-wearied, but he had lost none of
his strangely quiet energy.&nbsp; He wore a grave look, however,
for he now had learnt that the plague was prevailing at
Constantinople, and he was fearing that our two sick men, and the
miserable looks of our whole party, might make us unwelcome at
Pera.</p>
<p>We crossed the Golden Horn in a ca&iuml;que.&nbsp; As soon as
we had landed, some woebegone-looking fellows were got together
and laden with our baggage.&nbsp; Then on we went, dripping, and
sloshing, and looking very like men that had been turned back by
the Royal Humane Society as being incurably drowned.&nbsp;
Supporting our sick, we climbed up shelving steps and threaded
many windings, and at last came up into the main street of Pera,
humbly hoping that we might not be judged guilty of plague, and
so be cast back with horror from the doors of the shuddering
Christians.</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Such
was the condition of our party, which fifteen days before had
filed away so gaily from the gates of Belgrade.&nbsp; A couple of
fevers and a north-easterly storm had thoroughly spoiled our
looks.</p>
<p>The interest of Mysseri with the house of Giuseppini was too
powerful to be denied, and at once, though not without fear and
trembling, we were admitted as guests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> if we don&rsquo;t take a part
in the chant about &ldquo;mosques and minarets,&rdquo; we can
still yield praises to Stamboul.&nbsp; We can chant about the
harbour; we can say, and sing, that nowhere else does the sea
come so home to a city; there are no pebbly shores&mdash;no sand
bars&mdash;no slimy river-beds&mdash;no black canals&mdash;no
locks nor docks to divide the very heart of the place from the
deep waters.&nbsp; If being in the noisiest mart of Stamboul you
would stroll to the quiet side of the way amidst those cypresses
opposite, you will cross the fathomless Bosphorus; if you would
go from your hotel to the bazaars, you must go by the bright,
blue pathway of the Golden Horn, that can carry a thousand sail
of the line.&nbsp; You are accustomed to the gondolas that glide
among the palaces of St. Mark, but here at Stamboul it is a
120-gun ship that meets you in the street.&nbsp; Venice strains
out from the steadfast land, and in old times would send forth
the chief of the State to woo and wed the reluctant sea; but the
stormy bride of the Doge is the bowing slave of the Sultan.&nbsp;
She comes to his feet with the treasures of the world&mdash;she
bears him from palace to palace&mdash;by some unfailing
witchcraft she entices the breezes to <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>follow her <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a> and fan the pale cheek of her
lord&mdash;she lifts his armed navies to the very gates of his
garden&mdash;she watches the walls of his <i>serai</i>&mdash;she
stifles the intrigues of his ministers&mdash;she quiets the
scandals of his courts&mdash;she extinguishes his rivals, and
hushes his naughty wives all one by one.&nbsp; So vast are the
wonders of the deep!</p>
<p>All the while that I stayed at Constantinople the plague was
prevailing, but not with any degree of violence.&nbsp; Its
presence, however, lent a mysterious and exciting, though not
very pleasant, interest to my first knowledge of a great Oriental
city; it gave tone and colour to all I saw, and all I
felt&mdash;a tone and a colour sombre enough, but true, and well
befitting the dreary monuments of past power and splendour.&nbsp;
With all that is most truly Oriental in its character the plague
is associated; it dwells with the faithful in the holiest
quarters of their city.&nbsp; The coats and the hats of Pera are
held to be nearly as innocent of infection as they are ugly in
shape and fashion; but the rich furs and the costly shawls, the
broidered slippers and the gold-laden saddle-cloths, the
fragrance of burning aloes and the rich aroma of
patchouli&mdash;these are the signs that mark the familiar home
of plague.&nbsp; You go out from your queenly London&mdash;the
centre of the greatest and strongest amongst all earthly
dominions&mdash;you go out thence, and travel on to the capital
of an Eastern Prince, you find but a waning power, and a faded
splendour, that inclines you to laugh and mock; but let the
infernal Angel of Plague be at hand, and he, more mighty than
armies, more terrible than Suleyman in his glory, can <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>restore such
pomp and majesty to the weakness of the Imperial city, that if,
<i>when HE is there</i>, you must still go prying amongst the
shades of this dead empire, at least you will tread the path with
seemly reverence and awe.</p>
<p>It is the firm faith of almost all the Europeans living in the
East that plague is conveyed by the touch of infected substances,
and that the deadly atoms especially lurk in all kinds of clothes
and furs.&nbsp; It is held safer to breathe the same air with a
man sick of the plague, and even to come in contact with his
skin, than to be touched by the smallest particle of woollen or
of thread which may have been within the reach of possible
infection.&nbsp; If this be a right notion, the spread of the
malady must be materially aided by the observance of a custom
prevailing amongst the people of Stamboul.&nbsp; It is this: when
an Osmanlee dies, one of his dresses is cut up, and a small piece
of it is sent to each of his friends as a memorial of the
departed&mdash;a fatal present, according to the opinion of the
Franks, for it too often forces the living not merely to remember
the dead man, but to follow and bear him company.</p>
<p>The Europeans during the prevalence of the plague, if they are
forced to venture into the streets, will carefully avoid the
touch of every human being whom they pass.&nbsp; Their conduct in
this respect shows them strongly in contrast with the &ldquo;true
believers&rdquo;; the Moslem stalks on serenely, as though he
were under the eye of his God, and were &ldquo;equal to either
fate&rdquo;; the Franks go crouching and slinking from death, and
some (those chiefly of French extraction) will fondly strive to
fence out destiny with shining capes of oilskin!</p>
<p>For some time you may manage by great care to <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>thread your
way through the streets of Stamboul without incurring contact,
for the Turks, though scornful of the terrors felt by the Franks,
are generally very courteous in yielding to that which they hold
to be a useless and impious precaution, and will let you pass
safe if they can.&nbsp; It is impossible, however, that your
immunity can last for any length of time if you move about much
through the narrow streets and lanes of a crowded city.</p>
<p>As for me, I soon got &ldquo;compromised.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
one day of rest, the prayers of my hostess began to lose their
power of keeping me from the pestilent side of the Golden
Horn.&nbsp; Faithfully promising to shun the touch of all
imaginable substances, however enticing, I set off very
cautiously, and held my way uncompromised till I reached the
water&rsquo;s edge; but before my ca&iuml;que was quite ready
some rueful-looking fellows came rapidly shambling down the steps
with a plague-stricken corpse, which they were going to bury
amongst the faithful on the other side of the water.&nbsp; I
contrived to be so much in the way of this brisk funeral, that I
was not only touched by the men bearing the body, but also, I
believe, by the foot of the dead man, as it hung lolling out of
the bier.&nbsp; This accident gave me such a strong interest in
denying the soundness of the contagion theory, that I did in fact
deny and repudiate it altogether; and from that time, acting upon
my own convenient view of the matter, I went wherever I chose,
without taking any serious pains to avoid a touch.&nbsp; It seems
to me now very likely that the Europeans are right, and that the
plague may be really conveyed by contagion; but during the whole
time of my remaining in the East, my views on this subject more
nearly approached to those of the fatalists; and so, <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>when
afterwards the plague of Egypt came dealing his blows around me,
I was able to live amongst the dying without that alarm and
anxiety which would inevitably have pressed upon my mind if I had
allowed myself to believe that every passing touch was really a
probable death-stroke.</p>
<p>And perhaps as you make your difficult way through a steep and
narrow alley, shut in between blank walls, and little frequented
by passers, you meet one of those coffin-shaped bundles of white
linen that implies an Ottoman lady.&nbsp; Painfully struggling
against the obstacles to progression interposed by the many folds
of her clumsy drapery, by her big mud-boots, and especially by
her two pairs of slippers, she works her way on full awkwardly
enough, but yet there is something of womanly consciousness in
the very labour and effort with which she tugs and lifts the
burthen of her charms.&nbsp; She is closely followed by her women
slaves.&nbsp; Of her very self you see nothing except the dark,
luminous eyes that stare against your face, and the tips of the
painted fingers depending like rosebuds from out of the blank
bastions of the fortress.&nbsp; She turns, and turns again, and
carefully glances around her on all sides, to see that she is
safe from the eyes of Mussulmans, and then suddenly withdrawing
the <i>yashmak</i>, <a name="citation34"></a><a
href="#footnote34" class="citation">[34]</a> she shines upon your
heart and soul with all the pomp and might of her beauty.&nbsp;
And this, it is not the light, changeful grace that leaves you to
doubt whether you have fallen in love with a body, or only a
soul; it is the beauty that dwells secure in the perfectness of
hard, downright <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>outlines, and in the glow of generous colour.&nbsp;
There is fire, though, too&mdash;high courage and fire enough in
the untamed mind, or spirit, or whatever it is, which drives the
breath of pride through those scarcely parted lips.</p>
<p>You smile at pretty women&mdash;you turn pale before the
beauty that is great enough to have dominion over you.&nbsp; She
sees, and exults in your giddiness; she sees and smiles; then
presently, with a sudden movement, she lays her blushing fingers
upon your arm, and cries out, &ldquo;Yumourdjak!&rdquo; (Plague!
meaning, &ldquo;there is a present of the plague for
you!&rdquo;)&nbsp; This is her notion of a witticism.&nbsp; It is
a very old piece of fun, no doubt&mdash;quite an Oriental Joe
Miller; but the Turks are fondly attached, not only to the
institutions, but also to the jokes of their ancestors; so the
lady&rsquo;s silvery laugh rings joyously in your ears, and the
mirth of her women is boisterous and fresh, as though the bright
idea of giving the plague to a Christian had newly lit upon the
earth.</p>
<p>Methley began to rally very soon after we had reached
Constantinople; but there seemed at first to be no chance of his
regaining strength enough for travelling during the winter, and I
determined to stay with my comrade until he had quite recovered;
so I bought me a horse, and a &ldquo;pipe of tranquillity,&rdquo;
<a name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a> and took a Turkish phrase-master.&nbsp;
I troubled myself a great deal with the Turkish tongue, and
gained at last some knowledge of its structure.&nbsp; It is
enriched, perhaps overladen, with Persian and Arabic words,
imported into the language chiefly for <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the purpose of representing
sentiments and religious dogmas, and terms of art and luxury,
entirely unknown to the Tartar ancestors of the present
Osmanlees; but the body and the spirit of the old tongue are yet
alive, and the smooth words of the shopkeeper at Constantinople
can still carry understanding to the ears of the untamed millions
who rove over the plains of Northern Asia.&nbsp; The structure of
the language, especially in its more lengthy sentences, is very
like to the Latin: <a name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a> the subject matters are slowly and
patiently enumerated, without disclosing the purpose of the
speaker until he reaches the end of his sentence, and then at
last there comes the clenching word, which gives a meaning and
connection to all that has gone before.&nbsp; If you listen at
all to speaking of this kind, your attention, rather than be
suffered to flag, must grow more and more lively as the phrase
marches on.</p>
<p>The Osmanlees speak well.&nbsp; In countries civilised
according to the European plan the work of trying to persuade
tribunals is almost all performed by a set of men, the great body
of whom very seldom do anything else; but in Turkey this division
of labour <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>has never taken place, and every man is his own
advocate.&nbsp; The importance of the rhetorical art is immense,
for a bad speech may endanger the property of the speaker, as
well as the soles of his feet and the free enjoyment of his
throat.&nbsp; So it results that most of the Turks whom one sees
have a lawyer-like habit of speaking connectedly, and at
length.&nbsp; Even the treaties continually going on at the
bazaar for the buying and selling of the merest trifles are
carried on by speechifying rather than by mere colloquies, and
the eternal uncertainty as to the market value of things in
constant sale gives room enough for discussion.&nbsp; The seller
is for ever demanding a price immensely beyond that for which he
sells at last, and so occasions unspeakable disgust in many
Englishmen, who cannot see why an honest dealer should ask more
for his goods than he will really take!&nbsp; The truth is,
however, that an ordinary tradesman of Constantinople has no
other way of finding out the fair market value of his
property.&nbsp; The difficulty under which he labours is easily
shown by comparing the mechanism of the commercial system in
Turkey with that of our own country.&nbsp; In England, or in any
other great mercantile country, the bulk of the things bought and
sold goes through the hands of a wholesale dealer, and it is he
who higgles and bargains with an entire nation of purchasers by
entering into treaty with retail sellers.&nbsp; The labour of
making a few large contracts is sufficient to give a clue for
finding the fair market value of the goods sold throughout the
country; but in Turkey, from the primitive habits of the people,
and partly from the absence of great capital and great credit,
the importing merchant, the warehouseman, the wholesale dealer,
the retail dealer, and the shopman, are all <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>one
person.&nbsp; Old Moostapha, or Abdallah, or Hadgi Mohamed
waddles up from the water&rsquo;s edge with a small packet of
merchandise, which he has bought out of a Greek brigantine, and
when at last he has reached his nook in the bazaar he puts his
goods before the counter, and himself upon it; then laying fire
to his <i>tchibouque</i> he &ldquo;sits in permanence,&rdquo; and
patiently waits to obtain &ldquo;the best price that can be got
in an open market.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is his fair right as a
seller, but he has no means of finding out what that best price
is except by actual experiment.&nbsp; He cannot know the
intensity of the demand, or the abundance of the supply,
otherwise than by the offers which may be made for his little
bundle of goods; so he begins by asking a perfectly hopeless
price, and then descends the ladder until he meets a purchaser,
for ever</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Striving
to attain<br />
By shadowing out the unattainable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the struggle which creates the continual occasion for
debate.&nbsp; The vendor, perceiving that the unfolded
merchandise has caught the eye of a possible purchaser, commences
his opening speech.&nbsp; He covers his bristling broadcloths and
his meagre silks with the golden broidery of Oriental praises,
and as he talks, along with the slow and graceful waving of his
arms, he lifts his undulating periods, upholds and poises them
well, till they have gathered their weight and their strength,
and then hurls them bodily forward with grave, momentous
swing.&nbsp; The possible purchaser listens to the whole speech
with deep and serious attention; but when it is over <i>his</i>
turn arrives.&nbsp; He elaborately endeavours to show why he
ought not to buy the things at a price twenty <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>times larger
than their value.&nbsp; Bystanders attracted to the debate take a
part in it as independent members; the vendor is heard in reply,
and coming down with his price, furnishes the materials for a new
debate.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, the dealer, if he is a very
pious Mussulman, and sufficiently rich to hold back his ware,
will take a more dignified part, maintaining a kind of judicial
gravity, and receiving the applicants who come to his stall as if
they were rather suitors than customers.&nbsp; He will quietly
hear to the end some long speech that concludes with an offer,
and will answer it all with the one monosyllable
&ldquo;Yok,&rdquo; which means distinctly &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I caught one glimpse of the old heathen world.&nbsp; My habits
for studying military subjects had been hardening my heart
against poetry; for ever staring at the flames of battle, I had
blinded myself to the lesser and finer lights that are shed from
the imaginations of men.&nbsp; In my reading at this time I
delighted to follow from out of Arabian sands the feet of the
armed believers, and to stand in the broad, manifest storm-track
of Tartar devastation; and thus, though surrounded at
Constantinople by scenes of much interest to the &ldquo;classical
scholar,&rdquo; I had cast aside their associations like an old
Greek grammar, and turned my face to the &ldquo;shining
Orient,&rdquo; forgetful of old Greece and all the pure wealth
she left to this matter-of-fact-ridden world.&nbsp; But it
happened to me one day to mount the high grounds overhanging the
streets of Pera.&nbsp; I sated my eyes with the pomps of the city
and its crowded waters, and then I looked over where Scutari lay
half veiled in her mournful cypresses.&nbsp; I looked yet farther
and higher, and saw in the heavens a silvery cloud that stood
fast and still against the breeze: it was pure and dazzling
white, as <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>might be the veil of Cytherea, yet touched with such
fire, as though from beneath the loving eyes of an immortal were
shining through and through.&nbsp; I knew the bearing, but had
enormously misjudged its distance and underrated its height, and
so it was as a sign and a testimony, almost as a call from the
neglected gods, and now I saw and acknowledged the snowy crown of
the Mysian Olympus!</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE TROAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Methley</span> recovered almost suddenly,
and we determined to go through the Troad together.</p>
<p>My comrade was a capital Grecian.&nbsp; It is true that his
singular mind so ordered and disposed his classic lore as to
impress it with something of an original and barbarous
character&mdash;with an almost Gothic quaintness, more properly
belonging to a rich native ballad than to the poetry of
Hellas.&nbsp; There was a certain impropriety in his knowing so
much Greek&mdash;an unfitness in the idea of marble fauns, and
satyrs, and even Olympian gods, lugged in under the oaken roof
and the painted light of an odd, old Norman hall.&nbsp; But
Methley, abounding in Homer, <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>really loved him (as I believe) in
all truth, without whim or fancy; moreover, he had a good deal of
the practical sagacity</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of a Yorkshireman hippodamoio,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and this enabled him to apply his knowledge with much more
tact than is usually shown by people so learned as he.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>I, too,
loved Homer, but not with a scholar&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; The most
humble and pious among women was yet so proud a mother that she
could teach her firstborn son no Watts&rsquo; hymns, no collects
for the day; she could teach him in earliest childhood no less
than this, to find a home in his saddle, and to love old Homer,
and all that old Homer sung.&nbsp; True it is, that the Greek was
ingeniously rendered into English, the English of Pope even, but
not even a mesh like that can screen an earnest child from the
fire of Homer&rsquo;s battles.</p>
<p>I pored over the <i>Odyssey</i> as over a story-book, hoping
and fearing for the hero whom yet I partly scorned.&nbsp; But the
<i>Iliad</i>&mdash;line by line I clasped it to my brain with
reverence as well as with love.&nbsp; As an old woman deeply
trustful sits reading her Bible because of the world to come, so,
as though it would fit me for the coming strife of this temporal
world, I read and read the <i>Iliad</i>.&nbsp; Even outwardly, it
was not like other books; it was throned in towering
folios.&nbsp; There was a preface or dissertation printed in type
still more majestic than the rest of the book; this I read, but
not till my enthusiasm for the <i>Iliad</i> had already run
high.&nbsp; The writer compiling the opinions of many men, and
chiefly of the ancients, set forth, I know not how quaintly, that
the <i>Iliad</i> was all in all to the human race&mdash;that it
was history, poetry, revelation; that the works of men&rsquo;s
hands were folly and vanity, and would pass away like the dreams
of a child, but that the kingdom of Homer would endure for ever
and ever.</p>
<p>I assented with all my soul.&nbsp; I read, and still read; I
came to know Homer.&nbsp; A learned commentator knows something
of the Greeks, in the same sense as an oil-and-colour man may be
said to know <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>something of painting; but take an untamed child, and
leave him alone for twelve months with any translation of Homer,
and he will be nearer by twenty centuries to the spirit of old
Greece; <i>he</i> does not stop in the ninth year of the siege to
admire this or that group of words; <i>he</i> has no books in his
tent, but he shares in vital counsels with the &ldquo;king of
men,&rdquo; and knows the inmost souls of the impending gods; how
profanely he exults over the powers divine when they are taught
to dread the prowess of mortals! and most of all, how he rejoices
when the God of War flies howling from the spear of Diomed, and
mounts into heaven for safety!&nbsp; Then the beautiful episode
of the Sixth Book: the way to feel this is not to go casting
about, and learning from pastors and masters how best to admire
it.&nbsp; The impatient child is not grubbing for beauties, but
pushing the siege; the women vex him with their delays, and their
talking; the mention of the nurse is personal, and little
sympathy has he for the child that is young enough to be
frightened at the nodding plume of a helmet; but all the while
that he thus chafes at the pausing of the action, the strong
vertical light of Homer&rsquo;s poetry is blazing so full upon
the people and things of the <i>Iliad</i>, that soon to the eyes
of the child they grow familiar as his mother&rsquo;s shawl; yet
of this great gain he is unconscious, and on he goes, vengefully
thirsting for the best blood of Troy, and never remitting his
fierceness till almost suddenly it is changed for
sorrow&mdash;the new and generous sorrow that he learns to feel
when the noblest of all his foes lies sadly dying at the
Sc&aelig;an gate.</p>
<p>Heroic days are these, but the dark ages of schoolboy life
come closing over them.&nbsp; I suppose it is all right in the
end, yet, by Jove, at first sight it does <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>seem a sad
intellectual fall from your mother&rsquo;s dressing-room to a
buzzing school.&nbsp; You feel so keenly the delights of early
knowledge; you form strange mystic friendships with the mere
names of mountains, and seas, and continents, and mighty rivers;
you learn the ways of the planets, and transcend their narrow
limits, and ask for the end of space; you vex the electric
cylinder till it yields you, for your toy to play with, that
subtle fire in which our earth was forged; you know of the
nations that have towered high in the world, and the lives of the
men who have saved whole empires from oblivion.&nbsp; What more
will you ever learn?&nbsp; Yet the dismal change is ordained, and
then, thin meagre Latin (the same for everybody), with small
shreds and patches of Greek, is thrown like a pauper&rsquo;s pall
over all your early lore.&nbsp; Instead of sweet knowledge, vile,
monkish, doggerel grammars and graduses, dictionaries and
lexicons, and horrible odds and ends of dead languages, are given
you for your portion, and down you fall, from Roman story to a
three-inch scrap of &ldquo;Scriptores Romani,&rdquo;&mdash;from
Greek poetry down, down to the cold rations of &ldquo;Poet&aelig;
Gr&aelig;ci,&rdquo; cut up by commentators, and served out by
schoolmasters!</p>
<p>It was not the recollection of school nor college learning,
but the rapturous and earnest reading of my childhood, which made
me bend forward so longingly to the plains of Troy.</p>
<p>Away from our people and our horses, Methley and I went
loitering along by the willow banks of a stream that crept in
quietness through the low, even plain.&nbsp; There was no stir of
weather overhead, no sound of rural labour, no sign of life in
the land; but all the earth was dead and still, as though it had
lain for <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>thrice a thousand years under the leaden gloom of one
unbroken Sabbath.</p>
<p>Softly and sadly the poor, dumb, patient stream went winding
and winding along through its shifting pathway; in some places
its waters were parted, and then again, lower down, they would
meet once more.&nbsp; I could see that the stream from year to
year was finding itself new channels, and flowed no longer in its
ancient track, but I knew that the springs which fed it were high
on Ida&mdash;the springs of Simois and Scamander!</p>
<p>It was coldly and thanklessly, and with vacant, unsatisfied
eyes that I watched the slow coming and gliding away of the
waters.&nbsp; I tell myself now, as a profane fact, that I did
stand by that river (Methley gathered some seeds from the bushes
that grew there), but since that I am away from his banks,
&ldquo;divine Scamander&rdquo; has recovered the proper mystery
belonging to him as an unseen deity; a kind of indistinctness,
like that which belongs to far antiquity, has spread itself over
my memory, of the winding stream that I saw with these very
eyes.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s mind regains in absence that dominion
over earthly things which has been shaken by their rude
contact.&nbsp; You force yourself hardily into the material
presence of a mountain, or a river, whose name belongs to poetry
and ancient religion, rather than to the external world; your
feelings wound up and kept ready for some sort of half-expected
rapture are chilled, and borne down for the time under all this
load of real earth and water; but let these once pass out of
sight, and then again the old fanciful notions are restored, and
the mere realities which you have just been looking at are thrown
back so far into distance, that the very event of your intrusion
upon such scenes <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>begins to look dim and uncertain, as though it belonged
to mythology.</p>
<p>It is not over the plain before Troy that the river now flows;
its waters have edged away far towards the north, since the day
that &ldquo;divine Scamander&rdquo; (whom the gods call Xanthus)
went down to do battle for Ilion, &ldquo;with Mars, and Phoebus,
and Latona, and Diana glorying in her arrows, and Venus the lover
of smiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, when I was vexed at the migration of Scamander, and
the total loss or absorption of poor dear Simois, how happily
Methley reminded me that Homer himself had warned us of some such
changes!&nbsp; The Greeks in beginning their wall had neglected
the hecatombs due to the gods, and so after the fall of Troy
Apollo turned the paths of the rivers that flow from Ida, and
sent them flooding over the wall, till all the beach was smooth
and free from the unhallowed works of the Greeks.&nbsp; It is
true I see now, on looking to the passage, that Neptune, when the
work of destruction was done, turned back the rivers to their
ancient ways:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;
. . . &pi;&omicron;&tau;&alpha;&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&delta;&#8125; &epsilon;&tau;&rho;&epsilon;&psi;&epsilon;
&nu;&epsilon;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;<br />
&Kappa;&alpha;&rho;&#8125; &rho;&omicron;&omicron;&nu;
&#942;&pi;&epsilon;&rho;
&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&epsilon;&nu; &iota;&epsilon;&nu;

&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&iota;&rho;&rho;&omicron;&omicron;&nu;
&#8017;&delta;&omega;&rho;,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but their old channels passing through that light pervious
soil would have been lost in the nine days&rsquo; flood, and
perhaps the god, when he willed to bring back the rivers to their
ancient beds, may have done his work but ill: it is easier, they
say, to destroy than it is to restore.</p>
<p>We took to our horses again, and went southward towards the
very plain between Troy and the tents of the Greeks, but we rode
by a line at some distance from the shore.&nbsp; Whether it was
that the lay of the <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>ground hindered my view towards the sea, or that I was
all intent upon Ida, or whether my mind was in vacancy, or
whether, as is most like, I had strayed from the Dardan plains
all back to gentle England, there is now no knowing, nor caring,
but it was not quite suddenly indeed, but rather, as it were, in
the swelling and falling of a single wave, that the reality of
that very sea-view, which had bounded the sight of the Greeks,
now visibly acceded to me, and rolled full in upon my
brain.&nbsp; Conceive how deeply that eternal coastline, that
fixed horizon, those island rocks, must have graven their images
upon the minds of the Grecian warriors by the time that they had
reached the ninth year of the siege! conceive the strength, and
the fanciful beauty, of the speeches with which a whole army of
imagining men must have told their weariness, and how the
sauntering chiefs must have whelmed that daily, daily scene with
their deep Ionian curses!</p>
<p>And now it was that my eyes were greeted with a delightful
surprise.&nbsp; Whilst we were at Constantinople, Methley and I
had pored over the map together.&nbsp; We agreed that whatever
may have been the exact site of Troy, the Grecian camp must have
been nearly opposite to the space betwixt the islands of Imbros
and Tenedos,</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&Mu;&epsilon;&sigma;&sigma;&eta;&gamma;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&Tau;&epsilon;&nu;&epsilon;&delta;&omicron;&iota;&omicron;
&kappa;&alpha;&iota; &Iota;&mu;&beta;&rho;&omicron;&upsilon;
&pi;&alpha;&iota;&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&epsilon;&sigma;&sigma;&eta;&sigmaf;,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but Methley reminded me of a passage in the <i>Iliad</i> in
which Neptune is represented as looking at the scene of action
before Ilion from above the island of Samothrace.&nbsp; Now
Samothrace, according to the map, appeared to be not only out of
all seeing distance from the Troad, but to be entirely shut out
from it by the intervening Imbros, which is a larger <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>island,
stretching its length right athwart the line of sight from
Samothrace to Troy.&nbsp; Piously allowing that the dread
Commoter of our globe might have seen all mortal doings, even
from the depth of his own cerulean kingdom, I still felt that if
a station were to be chosen from which to see the fight, old
Homer, so material in his ways of thought, so averse from all
haziness and overreaching, would have <i>meant</i> to give the
god for his station some spot within reach of men&rsquo;s eyes
from the plains of Troy.&nbsp; I think that this testing of the
poet&rsquo;s words by map and compass may have shaken a little of
my faith in the completeness of his knowledge.&nbsp; Well, now I
had come; there to the south was Tenedos, and here at my side was
Imbros, all right, and according to the map, but aloft over
Imbros, aloft in a far-away heaven, was Samothrace, the
watch-tower of Neptune!</p>
<p>So Homer had appointed it, and so it was; the map was correct
enough, but could not, like Homer, convey <i>the whole
truth</i>.&nbsp; Thus vain and false are the mere human surmises
and doubts which clash with Homeric writ!</p>
<p>Nobody whose mind had not been reduced to the most deplorable
logical condition could look upon this beautiful congruity
betwixt the <i>Iliad</i> and the material world and yet bear to
suppose that the poet may have learned the features of the coast
from mere hearsay; now then, I believed; now I knew that Homer
had <i>passed along here</i>, that this vision of Samothrace
over-towering the nearer island was common to him and to me.</p>
<p>After a journey of some few days by the route of Adramiti and
Pergamo we reached Smyrna.&nbsp; The letters which Methley here
received obliged him to return to England.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">INFIDEL SMYRNA</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Smyrna</span>, or Giaour Izmir,
&ldquo;Infidel Smyrna,&rdquo; as the Mussulmans call it, is the
main point of commercial contact betwixt Europe and Asia.&nbsp;
You are there surrounded by the people, and the confused customs
of many and various nations; you see the fussy European adopting
the East, and calming his restlessness with the long Turkish
&ldquo;pipe of tranquillity&rdquo;; you see Jews offering
services, and receiving blows; <a name="citation50"></a><a
href="#footnote50" class="citation">[50]</a> on one side you have
a fellow whose dress and beard would give you a good idea of the
true Oriental, if it were not for the <i>gobe-mouche </i><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>expression of
countenance with which he is swallowing an article in the
<i>National</i>; and there, just by, is a genuine Osmanlee,
smoking away with all the majesty of a sultan, but before you
have time to admire sufficiently his tranquil dignity, and his
soft Asiatic repose, the poor old fellow is ruthlessly &ldquo;run
down&rdquo; by an English midshipman, who had set sail on a
Smyrna hack.&nbsp; Such are the incongruities of the
&ldquo;infidel city&rdquo; at ordinary times; but when I was
there, our friend Carrigaholt <a name="citation51"></a><a
href="#footnote51" class="citation">[51]</a> had imported himself
and his oddities as an accession to the other and inferior
wonders of Smyrna.</p>
<p>I was sitting alone in my room one day at Constantinople, when
I heard Methley approaching my door with shouts of laughter and
welcome, and presently I recognised that peculiar cry by which
our friend Carrigaholt expresses his emotions; he soon explained
to us the final causes by which the fates had worked out their
wonderful purpose of bringing him to Constantinople.&nbsp; He was
always, you know, very fond of sailing, but he had got into such
sad scrapes (including, I think, a lawsuit) on account of his
last yacht, that he took it into his head to have a cruise in a
merchant vessel, so he went to Liverpool, and looked through the
craft lying ready to sail, till he found a smart schooner that
perfectly suited his taste.&nbsp; The destination of the vessel
was the last thing he thought of; and when he was told that she
was bound for Constantinople, he merely assented to that as a
part of the arrangement to which he had no objection.&nbsp; As
soon as the vessel had sailed, the hapless passenger discovered
that his skipper carried on board an enormous wife, with an <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>inquiring
mind and an irresistible tendency to impart her opinions.&nbsp;
She looked upon her guest as upon a piece of waste intellect that
ought to be carefully tilled.&nbsp; She tilled him
accordingly.&nbsp; If the dons at Oxford could have seen poor
Carrigaholt thus absolutely &ldquo;attending lectures&rdquo; in
the Bay of Biscay, they would surely have thought him
sufficiently punished for all the wrongs he did them whilst he
was preparing himself under their care for the other and more
boisterous University.&nbsp; The voyage did not last more than
six or eight weeks, and the philosophy inflicted on Carrigaholt
was not entirely fatal to him; certainly he was somewhat
emaciated, and, for aught I know, he may have subscribed somewhat
too largely to the &ldquo;Feminine-right-of-reason
Society&rdquo;; but it did not appear that his health had been
seriously affected.&nbsp; There was a scheme on foot, it would
seem, for taking the passenger back to England in the same
schooner&mdash;a scheme, in fact, for keeping him perpetually
afloat, and perpetually saturated with arguments; but when
Carrigaholt found himself ashore, and remembered that the
skipperina (who had imprudently remained on board) was not there
to enforce her suggestions, he was open to the hints of his
servant (a very sharp fellow), who arranged a plan for escaping,
and finally brought off his master to Giuseppini&rsquo;s
hotel.</p>
<p>Our friend afterwards went by sea to Smyrna, and there he now
was in his glory.&nbsp; He had a good, or at all events a
gentleman-like, judgment in matters of taste, and as his great
object was to surround himself with all that his fancy could
dictate, he lived in a state of perpetual negotiation.&nbsp; He
was for ever on the point of purchasing, not only the material
productions of the place, but all sorts of such fine ware <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>as
&ldquo;intelligence,&rdquo; &ldquo;fidelity,&rdquo; and so
on.&nbsp; He was most curious, however, as the purchaser of the
&ldquo;affections.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes he would imagine that
he had a marital aptitude, and his fancy would sketch a graceful
picture, in which he appeared reclining on a divan, with a
beautiful Greek woman fondly couched at his feet, and soothing
him with the witchery of her guitar.&nbsp; Having satisfied
himself with the ideal picture thus created, he would pass into
action; the guitar he would buy instantly, and would give such
intimations of his wish to be wedded to a Greek as could not fail
to produce great excitement in the families of the beautiful
Smyrniotes.&nbsp; Then again (and just in time perhaps to save
him from the yoke) his dream would pass away, and another would
come in its stead; he would suddenly feel the yearnings of a
father&rsquo;s love, and willing by force of gold to transcend
all natural preliminaries, he would issue instructions for the
purchase of some dutiful child that could be warranted to love
him as a parent.&nbsp; Then at another time he would be convinced
that the attachment of menials might satisfy the longings of his
affectionate heart, and thereupon he would give orders to his
slave-merchant for something in the way of eternal
fidelity.&nbsp; You may well imagine that this anxiety of
Carrigaholt to purchase not only the scenery, but the many
<i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> belonging to his dreams, with all
their goodness and graces complete, necessarily gave an immense
stimulus to the trade and intrigue of Smyrna, and created a
demand for human virtues which the moral resources of the place
were totally inadequate to supply.&nbsp; Every day after
breakfast this lover of the good and the beautiful held a levee,
which was often exceedingly amusing.&nbsp; In his ante-room there
would be not only the sellers of <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>pipes and slippers and shawls, and
suchlike Oriental merchandise; not only embroiderers and cunning
workmen patiently striving to realise his visions of Albanian
dresses; not only the servants offering for places, and the
slave-dealer tendering his sable ware; but there would be the
Greek master, waiting to teach his pupil the grammar of the soft
Ionian tongue, in which he was to delight the wife of his
imagination; and the music-master, who was to teach him some
sweet replies to the anticipated sounds of the fancied guitar;
and then, above all, and proudly eminent with undisputed
preference of <i>entr&eacute;e</i>, and fraught with the
mysterious tidings on which the realisation of the whole dream
might depend, was the mysterious match-maker, <a
name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54"
class="citation">[54]</a> enticing and postponing the suitor, yet
ever keeping alive in his soul the love of that pictured virtue,
whose beauty (unseen by eyes) was half revealed to the
imagination.</p>
<p>You would have thought that this practical dreaming must have
soon brought Carrigaholt to a bad end, but he was in much less
danger than you would suppose; for besides that the new visions
of happiness almost always came in time to counteract the fatal
completion of the preceding scheme, his high breeding and his
delicately sensitive taste almost always came to his aid at times
when he was left without any other protection; and the efficacy
of these qualities in keeping a man out of harm&rsquo;s way is
really immense.&nbsp; In all baseness and imposture there is a
coarse, vulgar spirit, which, however artfully concealed for a
time, must sooner or later show itself in some little
circumstance sufficiently plain to occasion an instant jar upon
the minds of those whose taste is lively and true.&nbsp; <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>To such men a
shock of this kind, disclosing the <i>ugliness</i> of a cheat, is
more effectively convincing than any mere proofs could be.</p>
<p>Thus guarded from isle to isle, and through Greece, and
through Albania, this practical Plato with a purse in his hand,
carried on his mad chase after the good and the beautiful, and
yet returned in safety to his home.&nbsp; But now, poor fellow!
the lowly grave, that is the end of men&rsquo;s romantic hopes,
has closed over all his rich fancies, and all his high
aspirations; he is utterly married!&nbsp; No more hope, no more
change for him&mdash;no more relays&mdash;he must go on
Vetturini-wise to the appointed end of his journey!</p>
<p>Smyrna, I think, may be called the chief town and capital of
the Grecian race, against which you will be cautioned so
carefully as soon as you touch the Levant.&nbsp; You will say
that I ought not to confound as one people the Greeks living
under a constitutional Government with the unfortunate Rayahs who
&ldquo;groan under the Turkish yoke,&rdquo; but I can&rsquo;t see
that political events have hitherto produced any strongly marked
difference of character.&nbsp; If I could venture to rely (which
I feel that I cannot at all do) upon my own observation, I should
tell you that there was more heartiness and strength in the
Greeks of the Ottoman Empire than in those of the new
kingdom.&nbsp; The truth is, that there is a greater field for
commercial enterprise, and even for Greek ambition, under the
Ottoman sceptre, than is to be found in the dominions of
Otho.&nbsp; Indeed the people, by their frequent migrations from
the limits of the constitutional kingdom to the territories of
the Porte, seem to show that, on the whole, they prefer
&ldquo;groaning under the Turkish yoke&rdquo; to the honour <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>of
&ldquo;being the only true source of legitimate power&rdquo; in
their own land.</p>
<p>For myself, I love the race; in spite of all their vices, and
even in spite of all their meannesses, I remember the blood that
is in them, and still love the Greeks.&nbsp; The Osmanlees are,
of course, by nature, by religion, and by politics, the strong
foes of the Hellenic people; and as the Greeks, poor fellows!
happen to be a little deficient in some of the virtues which
facilitate the transaction of commercial business (such as
veracity, fidelity, etc.), it naturally follows that they are
highly unpopular with the European merchants.&nbsp; Now these are
the persons through whom, either directly or indirectly, is
derived the greater part of the information which you gather in
the Levant, and therefore you must make up your mind to hear an
almost universal and unbroken testimony against the character of
the people whose ancestors invented virtue.&nbsp; And strange to
say, the Greeks themselves do not attempt to disturb this general
unanimity of opinion by any dissent on their part.&nbsp; Question
a Greek on the subject, and he will tell you at once that the
people are <i>traditori</i>, and will then, perhaps, endeavour to
shake off his fair share of the imputation by asserting that his
father had been dragoman to some foreign embassy, and that he
(the son), therefore, by the law of nations, had ceased to be
Greek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E dunque no siete traditore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibile, signor, ma almeno Io no sono
Greco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not even the diplomatic representatives of the Hellenic
kingdom are free from the habit of depreciating their
brethren.&nbsp; I recollect that at one of the ports in Syria a
Greek vessel was rather unfairly kept in quarantine by order of
the Board of Health, <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>which consisted entirely of
Europeans.&nbsp; A consular agent from the kingdom of Greece had
lately hoisted his flag in the town, and the captain of the
vessel drew up a remonstrance, which he requested his consul to
present to the Board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, <i>is</i> this reasonable?&rdquo; said the consul;
&ldquo;is it reasonable that I should place myself in collision
with all the principal European gentlemen of the place for the
sake of you, a Greek?&rdquo;&nbsp; The skipper was greatly vexed
at the failure of his application, but he scarcely even
questioned the justice of the ground which his consul had
taken.&nbsp; Well, it happened some time afterwards that I found
myself at the same port, having gone thither with the view of
embarking for the port of Syra.&nbsp; I was anxious, of course,
to elude as carefully as possible the quarantine detentions which
threatened me on my arrival, and hearing that the Greek consul
had a brother who was a man in authority at Syra, I got myself
presented to the former, and took the liberty of asking him to
give me such a letter of introduction to his relative at Syra as
might possibly have the effect of shortening the term of my
quarantine.&nbsp; He acceded to this request with the utmost
kindness and courtesy; but when he replied to my thanks by saying
that &ldquo;in serving an Englishman he was doing no more than
his strict duty commanded,&rdquo; not even my gratitude could
prevent me from calling to mind his treatment of the poor captain
who had the misfortune of not being an alien in blood to his
consul and appointed protector.</p>
<p>I think that the change which has taken place in the character
of the Greeks has been occasioned, in great measure, by the
doctrines and practice of their religion.&nbsp; The Greek Church
has animated the <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>Muscovite peasant, and inspired him with hopes and ideas
which, however humble, are still better than none at all; but the
faith, and the forms, and the strange ecclesiastical literature
which act so advantageously upon the mere clay of the Russian
serf, seem to hang like lead upon the ethereal spirit of the
Greek.&nbsp; Never in any part of the world have I seen religious
performances so painful to witness as those of the Greeks.&nbsp;
The horror, however, with which one shudders at their worship is
attributable, in some measure, to the mere effect of
costume.&nbsp; In all the Ottoman dominions, and very frequently
too in the kingdom of Otho, the Greeks wear turbans or other
head-dresses, and shave their heads, leaving only a
rat&rsquo;s-tail at the crown of the head; they of course keep
themselves covered within doors as well as abroad, and they never
remove their headgear merely on account of being in a church; but
when the Greek stops to worship at his proper shrine, then, and
then only, he always uncovers; and as you see him thus with
shaven skull and savage tail depending from his crown, kissing a
thing of wood and glass, and cringing with base prostrations and
apparent terror before a miserable picture, you see superstition
in a shape which, outwardly at least, is sadly abject and
repulsive.</p>
<p>The fasts, too, of the Greek Church produce an ill effect upon
the character of the people, for they are not a mere farce, but
are carried to such an extent as to bring about a real
mortification of the flesh; the febrile irritation of the frame
operating in conjunction with the depression of the spirits
occasioned by abstinence, will so far answer the objects of the
rite, as to engender some religious excitement, but this is of a
morbid and gloomy <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>character, and it seems to be certain, that along with
the increase of sanctity, there comes a fiercer desire for the
perpetration of dark crimes.&nbsp; The number of murders
committed during Lent is greater, I am told, than at any other
time of the year.&nbsp; A man under the influence of a bean
dietary (for this is the principal food of the Greeks during
their fasts) will be in an apt humour for enriching the shrine of
his saint, and passing a knife through his next-door
neighbour.&nbsp; The moneys deposited upon the shrines are
appropriated by priests; the priests are married men, and have
families to provide for; they &ldquo;take the good with the
bad,&rdquo; and continue to recommend fasts.</p>
<p>Then, too, the Greek Church enjoins her followers to keep holy
such a vast number of saints&rsquo; days as practically to
shorten the lives of the people very materially.&nbsp; I believe
that one-third out of the number of days in the year are
&ldquo;kept holy,&rdquo; or rather, <i>kept stupid</i>, in honour
of the saints; no great portion of the time thus set apart is
spent in religious exercises, and the people don&rsquo;t betake
themselves to any such animating pastimes as might serve to
strengthen the frame, or invigorate the mind, or exalt the
taste.&nbsp; On the contrary, the saints&rsquo; days of the
Greeks in Smyrna are passed in the same manner as the Sabbaths of
well-behaved Protestant housemaids in London&mdash;that is to
say, in a steady and serious contemplation of street
scenery.&nbsp; The men perform this duty <i>at the doors</i> of
their houses, the women <i>at the windows</i>, which the custom
of Greek towns has so decidedly appropriated to them as the
proper station of their sex, that a man would be looked upon as
utterly effeminate if he ventured to choose that situation for
the keeping of the saints&rsquo; days.&nbsp; I was <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>present one
day at a treaty for the hire of some apartments at Smyrna, which
was carried on between Carrigaholt and the Greek woman to whom
the rooms belonged.&nbsp; Carrigaholt objected that the windows
commanded no view of the street.&nbsp; Immediately the brow of
the majestic matron clouded, and with all the scorn of a Spartan
mother she coolly asked Carrigaholt, and said, &ldquo;Art thou a
tender damsel that thou wouldst sit and gaze from
windows?&rdquo;&nbsp; The man whom she addressed, however, had
not gone to Greece with any intention of placing himself under
the laws of Lycurgus, and was not to be diverted from his views
by a Spartan rebuke, so he took care to find himself windows
after his own heart, and there, I believe, for many a month, he
kept the saints&rsquo; days, and all the days intervening, after
the fashion of Grecian women.</p>
<p>Oh! let me be charitable to all who write, and to all who
lecture, and to all who preach, since even I, a layman not forced
to write at all, can hardly avoid chiming in with some tuneful
cant!&nbsp; I have had the heart to talk about the pernicious
effects of the Greek holidays, to which I owe some of my most
beautiful visions!&nbsp; I will let the words stand, as a
humbling proof that I am subject to that immutable law which
compels a man with a pen in his hand to be uttering every now and
then some sentiment not his own.&nbsp; It seems as though the
power of expressing regrets and desires by written symbols were
coupled with a condition that the writer should from time to time
express the regrets and desires of other people; as though, like
a French peasant under the old r&eacute;gime, one were bound to
perform a certain amount of work <i>upon the public
highways</i>.&nbsp; I rebel as stoutly as I can against this
horrible <i>corv&eacute;e</i>.&nbsp; I try not to deceive <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>you&mdash;I
try to set down the thoughts which are fresh within me, and not
to pretend any wishes, or griefs, which I do not really feel; but
no sooner do I cease from watchfulness in this regard, than my
right hand is, as it were, seized by some false angel, and even
now, you see, I have been forced to put down such words and
sentences as I ought to have written if really and truly I had
wished to disturb the saints&rsquo; days of the beautiful
Smyrniotes!</p>
<p>Which, Heaven forbid! for as you move through the narrow
streets of the city at these times of festival, the
transom-shaped windows suspended over your head on either side
are filled with the beautiful descendants of the old Ionian race;
all (even yonder empress that sits throned at the window of that
humblest mud cottage) are attired with seeming magnificence;
their classic heads are crowned with scarlet, and loaded with
jewels or coins of gold, the whole wealth of the wearer; <a
name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61"
class="citation">[61]</a> their features are touched with a
savage pencil, which hardens the outline of eyes and eyebrows,
and lends an unnatural fire to the stern, grave looks with which
they pierce your brain.&nbsp; Endure their fiery eyes as best you
may, and ride on slowly and reverently, for facing you from the
side of the transom, that looks longwise through the street, you
see the one glorious shape transcendent in its beauty; you see
the massive braid of hair as it catches a touch of light on its
jetty surface, and the broad, calm, angry brow; the large black
eyes, deep set, and self-relying like the eyes of <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>a conqueror,
with their rich shadows of thought lying darkly around them; you
see the thin fiery nostril, and the bold line of the chin and
throat disclosing all the fierceness, and all the pride, passion,
and power that can live along with the rare womanly beauty of
those sweetly turned lips.&nbsp; But then there is a terrible
stillness in this breathing image; it seems like the stillness of
a savage that sits intent and brooding, day by day, upon some one
fearful scheme of vengeance, but yet more like it seems to the
stillness of an Immortal, whose will must be known, and obeyed
without sign or speech.&nbsp; Bow down!&mdash;Bow down and adore
the young Persephonie, transcendent Queen of Shades!</p>

63</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">GREEK MARINERS</span></h2>
<p>I sailed from Smyrna in the <i>Amphitrite</i>, a Greek
brigantine, which was confidently said to be bound for the coast
of Syria; but I knew that this announcement was not to be relied
upon with positive certainty, for the Greek mariners are
practically free from the stringency of ship&rsquo;s papers, and
where they will, there they go.&nbsp; However, I had the whole of
the cabin for myself and my attendant, Mysseri, subject only to
the society of the captain at the hour of dinner.&nbsp; Being at
ease in this respect, being furnished too with plenty of books,
and finding an unfailing source of interest in the thorough
Greekness of my captain and my crew, I felt less anxious than
most people would have been about the probable length of the
cruise.&nbsp; I knew enough of Greek navigation to be sure that
our vessel would cling to earth like a child to its
mother&rsquo;s knee, and that I should touch at many an isle
before I set foot upon the Syrian coast; but I had no invidious
preference for Europe, Asia, or Africa, and I felt that I could
defy the winds to blow me upon a coast that was blank and void of
interest.&nbsp; My patience was extremely useful to me, for the
cruise altogether endured some forty days, and that in the midst
of winter.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>According to me, the most interesting of all the Greeks
(male Greeks) are the mariners, because their pursuits and their
social condition are so nearly the same as those of their famous
ancestors.&nbsp; You will say, that the occupation of commerce
must have smoothed down the salience of their minds; and this
would be so perhaps, if their mercantile affairs were conducted
according to the fixed business-like routine of Europeans; but
the ventures of the Greeks are surrounded by such a multitude of
imagined dangers (and from the absence of regular marts, in which
the true value of merchandise can be ascertained), are so
entirely speculative, and besides, are conducted in a manner so
wholly determined upon by the wayward fancies and wishes of the
crew, that they belong to enterprise rather than to industry, and
are very far indeed from tending to deaden any freshness of
character.</p>
<p>The vessels in which war and piracy were carried on during the
years of the Greek Revolution became merchantmen at the end of
the war; but the tactics of the Greeks, as naval warriors, were
so exceedingly cautious, and their habits as commercial mariners
are so wild, that the change has been more slight than you might
imagine.&nbsp; The first care of Greeks (Greek Rayahs) when they
undertake a shipping enterprise is to procure for their vessel
the protection of some European power.&nbsp; This is easily
managed by a little intriguing with the dragoman of one of the
embassies at Constantinople, and the craft soon glories in the
ensign of Russia, or the dazzling Tricolor, or the Union
Jack.&nbsp; Thus, to the great delight of her crew, she enters
upon the ocean world with a flaring lie at her peak, but the
appearance of the vessel does no discredit to the borrowed flag;
<a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>she is
frail indeed, but is gracefully built, and smartly rigged; she
always carries guns, and, in short, gives good promise of
mischief and speed.</p>
<p>The privileges attached to the vessel and her crew by virtue
of the borrowed flag are so great, as to imply a liberty wider
even than that which is often enjoyed in our more strictly
civilised countries, so that there is no pretence for saying that
the development of the true character belonging to Greek mariners
is prevented by the dominion of the Ottoman.&nbsp; These men are
free, too, from the power of the great capitalist, whose sway is
more withering than despotism itself to the enterprises of humble
venturers.&nbsp; The capital employed is supplied by those whose
labour is to render it productive.&nbsp; The crew receive no
wages, but have all a share in the venture, and in general, I
believe, they are the owners of the whole freight.&nbsp; They
choose a captain, to whom they entrust just power enough to keep
the vessel on her course in fine weather, but not quite enough
for a gale of wind; they also elect a cook and a mate.&nbsp; The
cook whom we had on board was particularly careful about the
ship&rsquo;s reckoning, and when under the influence of the keen
sea-breezes we grew fondly expectant of an instant dinner, the
great author of <i>pilafs</i> would be standing on deck with an
ancient quadrant in his hands, calmly affecting to take an
observation.&nbsp; But then to make up for this the captain would
be exercising a controlling influence over the soup, so that all
in the end went well.&nbsp; Our mate was a Hydriot, a native of
that island rock which grows nothing but mariners and
mariners&rsquo; wives.&nbsp; His character seemed to be exactly
that which is generally attributed to the Hydriot race; he was
fierce, and gloomy, and lonely in his ways.&nbsp; <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>One of his
principal duties seemed to be that of acting as counter-captain,
or leader of the opposition, denouncing the first symptoms of
tyranny, and protecting even the cabin-boy from oppression.&nbsp;
Besides this, when things went smoothly he would begin to
prognosticate evil, in order that his more lighthearted comrades
might not be puffed up with the seeming good fortune of the
moment.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that the personal freedom of these sailors,
who own no superiors except those of their own choice, is as like
as may be to that of their seafaring ancestors.&nbsp; And even in
their mode of navigation they have admitted no such an entire
change as you would suppose probable.&nbsp; It is true that they
have so far availed themselves of modern discoveries as to look
to the compass instead of the stars, and that they have
superseded the immortal gods of their forefathers by St. Nicholas
in his glass case, <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a> but they are not yet so confident
either in their needle, or their saint, as to love an open sea,
and they still hug their shores as fondly as the Argonauts of
old.&nbsp; Indeed, they have a most unsailor-like love for the
land, and I really believe that in a gale of wind they would
rather have a rock-bound coast on their lee than no coast at
all.&nbsp; According to the notions of an English seaman, this
kind of navigation would soon bring the vessel on which it might
be practised to an evil end.&nbsp; The Greek, however, is
unaccountably successful in escaping the consequences of being
&ldquo;jammed in,&rdquo; as it is called, upon a lee-shore.</p>
<p>These seamen, like their forefathers, rely upon no <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>winds unless
they are right astern or on the quarter; they rarely go <i>on</i>
a wind if it blows at all fresh, and if the adverse breeze
approaches to a gale, they at once fumigate St. Nicholas, and put
up the helm.&nbsp; The consequence, of course, is that under the
ever-varying winds of the &AElig;gean they are blown about in the
most whimsical manner.&nbsp; I used to think that Ulysses, with
his ten years&rsquo; voyage, had taken his time in making Ithaca,
but my experience in Greek navigation soon made me understand
that he had had, in point of fact, a pretty good &ldquo;average
passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such are now the mariners of the &AElig;gean: free, equal
amongst themselves, navigating the seas of their forefathers with
the same heroic, and yet childlike, spirit of venture, the same
half-trustful reliance upon heavenly aid, they are the liveliest
images of true old Greeks that time and the new religions have
spared to us.</p>
<p>With one exception, our crew were &ldquo;a solemn
company,&rdquo; <a name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a> and yet, sometimes, when all things
went well, they would relax their austerity, and show a
disposition to fun, or rather to quiet humour.&nbsp; When this
happened, they invariably had recourse to one of their number,
who went by the name of &ldquo;Admiral Nicolou.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was an amusing fellow, the poorest, I believe, and the least
thoughtful of the crew, but full of rich humour.&nbsp; His
oft-told story of the events by which he had gained the sobriquet
of &ldquo;Admiral&rdquo; never failed to delight his hearers, and
when he was desired to repeat it for my benefit, the rest of the
crew crowded round with as much interest as if they were
listening to the tale for the first time.&nbsp; A number of Greek
brigs and brigantines were at anchor in the bay of Beyrout.&nbsp;
<a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>A festival
of some kind, particularly attractive to the sailors, was going
on in the town, and whether with or without leave I know not, but
the crews of all the craft, except that of Nicolou, had gone
ashore.&nbsp; On board his vessel, however, which carried
dollars, there was, it would seem, a more careful, or more
influential captain, who was able to enforce his determination
that one man, at least, should be left on board.&nbsp;
Nicolou&rsquo;s good nature was with him so powerful an impulse,
that he could not resist the delight of volunteering to stay with
the vessel whilst his comrades went ashore.&nbsp; His proposal
was accepted, and the crew and captain soon left him alone on the
deck of his vessel.&nbsp; The sailors, gathering together from
their several ships, were amusing themselves in the town, when
suddenly there came down from betwixt the mountains one of those
sudden hurricanes which sometimes occur in southern climes.&nbsp;
Nicolou&rsquo;s vessel, together with four of the craft which had
been left unmanned, broke from her moorings, and all five of the
vessels were carried out seaward.&nbsp; The town is on a salient
point at the southern side of the bay, so that &ldquo;that
Admiral&rdquo; was close under the eyes of the inhabitants and
the shore-gone sailors when he gallantly drifted out at the head
of his little fleet.&nbsp; If Nicolou could not entirely control
the man&oelig;uvres of the squadron, there was at least no human
power to divide his authority, and thus it was that he took rank
as &ldquo;Admiral.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nicolou cut his cable, and thus
for the time saved his vessel; for the rest of the fleet under
his command were quickly wrecked, whilst &ldquo;the
Admiral&rdquo; got away clear to the open sea.&nbsp; The violence
of the squall soon passed off, but Nicolou felt that his chance
of one day resigning his high duties as an <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>admiral for
the enjoyments of private life on the steadfast shore mainly
depended upon his success in working the brig with his own hands,
so after calling on his namesake, the saint (not for the first
time, I take it), he got up some canvas, and took the helm: he
became equal, he told us, to a score of Nicolous, and the vessel,
as he said, was &ldquo;manned with his terrors.&rdquo;&nbsp; For
two days, it seems, he cruised at large, but at last, either by
his seamanship, or by the natural instinct of the Greek mariners
for finding land, he brought his craft close to an unknown shore,
that promised well for his purpose of running in the vessel; and
he was preparing to give her a good berth on the beach, when he
saw a gang of ferocious-looking fellows coming down to the point
for which he was making.&nbsp; Poor Nicolou was a perfectly
unlettered and untutored genius, and for that reason, perhaps, a
keen listener to tales of terror.&nbsp; His mind had been
impressed with some horrible legend of cannibalism, and he now
did not doubt for a moment that the men awaiting him on the beach
were the monsters at whom he had shuddered in the days of his
childhood.&nbsp; The coast on which Nicolou was running his
vessel was somewhere, I fancy, at the foot of the Anzairie
Mountains, and the fellows who were preparing to give him a
reception were probably very rough specimens of humanity.&nbsp;
It is likely enough that they might have given themselves the
trouble of putting &ldquo;the Admiral&rdquo; to death, for the
purpose of simplifying their claim to the vessel and preventing
litigation, but the notion of their cannibalism was of course
utterly unfounded.&nbsp; Nicolou&rsquo;s terror had, however, so
graven the idea on his mind, that he could never afterwards
dismiss it.&nbsp; Having once determined the character of his
expectant hosts, <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>the Admiral naturally thought that it would be better to
keep their dinner waiting any length of time than to attend their
feast in the character of a roasted Greek, so he put about his
vessel, and tempted the deep once more.&nbsp; After a further
cruise the lonely commander ran his vessel upon some rocks at
another part of the coast, where she was lost with all her
treasures, and Nicolou was but too glad to scramble ashore,
though without one dollar in his girdle.&nbsp; These adventures
seem flat enough as I repeat them, but the hero expressed his
terrors by such odd terms of speech, and such strangely humorous
gestures, that the story came from his lips with an unfailing
zest, so that the crew, who had heard the tale so often, could
still enjoy to their hearts&rsquo; content the rich fright of the
Admiral, and still shuddered with unabated horror when he came to
the loss of the dollars.</p>
<p>The power of listening to long stories (for which, by the bye,
I am giving you large credit) is common, I fancy, to most
sailors, and the Greeks have it to a high degree, for they can be
perfectly patient under a narrative of two or three hours&rsquo;
duration.&nbsp; These long stories are mostly founded upon
Oriental topics, and in one of them I recognised with some
alteration an old friend of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>.&nbsp; I
inquired as to the source from which the story had been derived,
and the crew all agreed that it had been handed down unwritten
from Greek to Greek.&nbsp; Their account of the matter does not,
perhaps, go very far towards showing the real origin of the tale;
but when I afterwards took up the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, I became
strongly impressed with a notion that they must have sprung from
the brain of a Greek.&nbsp; It seems to me that these stories,
whilst <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>they disclose a complete and habitual knowledge of
things Asiatic, have about them so much of freshness and life, so
much of the stirring and volatile European character, that they
cannot have owed their conception to a mere Oriental, who for
creative purposes is a thing dead and dry&mdash;a mental mummy,
that may have been a live king just after the Flood, but has
since lain balmed in spice.&nbsp; At the time of the Caliphat the
Greek race was familiar enough to Baghdad: they were the
merchants, the pedlars, the barbers, and intriguers-general of
south-western Asia, and therefore the Oriental materials with
which the Arabian tales were wrought must have been completely at
the command of the inventive people to whom I would attribute
their origin.</p>
<p>We were nearing the isle of Cyprus when there arose half a
gale of wind, with a heavy chopping sea.&nbsp; My Greek seamen
considered that the weather amounted not to a half, but to an
integral gale of wind at the very least, so they put up the helm,
and scudded for twenty hours.&nbsp; When we neared the mainland
of Anadoli the gale ceased, and a favourable breeze sprung up,
which brought us off Cyprus once more.&nbsp; Afterwards the wind
changed again, but we were still able to lay our course by
sailing close-hauled.</p>
<p>We were at length in such a position, that by holding on our
course for about half an hour we should get under the lee of the
island and find ourselves in smooth water, but the wind had been
gradually freshening; it now blew hard, and there was a heavy sea
running.</p>
<p>As the grounds for alarm arose, the crew gathered together in
one close group; they stood pale and grim under their hooded
capotes like monks awaiting <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>a massacre, anxiously looking by
turns along the pathway of the storm and then upon each other,
and then upon the eye of the captain who stood by the
helmsman.&nbsp; Presently the Hydriot came aft, more moody than
ever, the bearer of fierce remonstrance against the continuing of
the struggle; he received a resolute answer, and still we held
our course.&nbsp; Soon there came a heavy sea, that caught the
bow of the brigantine as she lay jammed in betwixt the waves; she
bowed her head low under the waters, and shuddered through all
her timbers, then gallantly stood up again over the striving sea,
with bowsprit entire.&nbsp; But where were the crew?&nbsp; It was
a crew no longer, but rather a gathering of Greek citizens; the
shout of the seamen was changed for the murmuring of the
people&mdash;the spirit of the old Demos was alive.&nbsp; The men
came aft in a body, and loudly asked that the vessel should be
put about, and that the storm be no longer tempted.&nbsp; Now
then, for speeches.&nbsp; The captain, his eyes flashing fire,
his frame all quivering with emotion&mdash;wielding his every
limb, like another and a louder voice, pours forth the eloquent
torrent of his threats and his reasons, his commands and his
prayers; he promises, he vows, he swears that there is safety in
holding on&mdash;safety, <i>if Greeks will be brave</i>!&nbsp;
The men hear and are moved; but the gale rouses itself once more,
and again the raging sea comes trampling over the timbers that
are the life of all.&nbsp; The fierce Hydriot advances one step
nearer to the captain, and the angry growl of the people goes
floating down the wind, but they listen; they waver once more,
and once more resolve, then waver again, thus doubtfully hanging
between the terrors of the storm and the persuasion of glorious
speech, as though it were the <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Athenian that talked, and Philip of
Macedon that thundered on the weather-bow.</p>
<p>Brave thoughts winged on Grecian words gained their natural
mastery over terror; the brigantine held on her course, and
reached smooth water at last.&nbsp; I landed at Limasol, the
westernmost port of Cyprus, leaving the vessel to sail for
Larnaca, where she was to remain for some days.</p>
<h2><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CYPRUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a Greek at Limasol who
hoisted his flag as an English vice-consul, and he insisted upon
my accepting his hospitality.&nbsp; With some difficulty, and
chiefly by assuring him that I could not delay my departure
beyond an early hour in the afternoon, I induced him to allow my
dining with his family instead of banqueting all alone with the
representative of my Sovereign in consular state and
dignity.&nbsp; The lady of the house, it seemed, had never sat at
table with a European.&nbsp; She was very shy about the matter,
and tried hard to get out of the scrape, but the husband, I
fancy, reminded her that she was theoretically an Englishwoman,
by virtue of the flag that waved over her roof, and that she was
bound to show her nationality by sitting at meat with me.&nbsp;
Finding herself inexorably condemned to bear with the dreaded
gaze of European eyes, she tried to save her innocent children
from the hard fate awaiting herself, but I obtained that all of
them (and I think there were four or five) should sit at the
table.&nbsp; You will meet with abundance of stately receptions
and of generous hospitality, too, in the East, but rarely, very
rarely in those regions (or even, so far as I know, in any part
of southern Europe) does one gain an <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>opportunity of seeing the familiar
and indoor life of the people.</p>
<p>This family party of the good consul&rsquo;s (or rather of
mine, for I originated the idea, though he furnished the
materials) went off very well.&nbsp; The mamma was shy at first,
but she veiled the awkwardness which she felt by affecting to
scold her children, who had all of them, I think, immortal
names&mdash;names too which they owed to tradition, and certainly
not to any classical enthusiasm of their parents.&nbsp; Every
instant I was delighted by some such phrases as these,
&ldquo;Themistocles, my love, don&rsquo;t
fight.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Alcibiades, can&rsquo;t you sit
still?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Socrates, put down the
cup.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, fie! Aspasia don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Oh!
don&rsquo;t be naughty!&rdquo;&nbsp; It is true that the names
were pronounced Socr&#257;htie, Asp&#257;hsie&mdash;that is,
according to accent, and not according to quantity&mdash;but I
suppose it is scarcely now to be doubted that they were so
sounded in ancient times.</p>
<p>To me it seems, that of all the lands I know (you will see in
a minute how I connect this piece of prose with the Isle of
Cyprus), there is none in which mere wealth, mere unaided wealth,
is held half so cheaply; none in which a poor devil of a
millionaire, without birth, or ability, occupies so humble a
place as in England.&nbsp; My Greek host and I were sitting
together, I think, upon the roof of the house (for that is the
lounging-place in Eastern climes), when the former assumed a
serious air, and intimated a wish to converse upon the subject of
the British Constitution, with which he assured me that he was
thoroughly acquainted.&nbsp; He presently, however, informed me
that there was one anomalous circumstance attended upon the
practical working of our political system which he had never been
able to <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>hear explained in a manner satisfactory to
himself.&nbsp; From the fact of his having found a difficulty in
his subject, I began to think that my host might really know
rather more of it than his announcement of a thorough knowledge
had led me to expect.&nbsp; I felt interested at being about to
hear from the lips of an intelligent Greek, quite remote from the
influence of European opinions, what might seem to him the most
astonishing and incomprehensible of all those results which have
followed from the action of our political institutions.&nbsp; The
anomaly, the only anomaly which had been detected by the
vice-consular wisdom, consisted in the fact that Rothschild (the
late money-monger) had never been the Prime Minister of
England!&nbsp; I gravely tried to throw some light upon the
mysterious causes that had kept the worthy Israelite out of the
Cabinet, but I think I could see that my explanation was not
satisfactory.&nbsp; Go and argue with the flies of summer that
there is a power divine, yet greater than the sun in the heavens,
but never dare hope to convince the people of the south that
there is any other God than Gold.</p>
<p>My intended journey was to the site of the Paphian
temple.&nbsp; I take no antiquarian interest in ruins, and care
little about them, unless they are either striking in themselves,
or else serve to mark some spot on which my fancy loves to
dwell.&nbsp; I knew that the ruins of Paphos were scarcely, if at
all, discernible, but there was a will and a longing more
imperious than mere curiosity that drove me thither.</p>
<p>For this just then was my pagan soul&rsquo;s desire&mdash;that
(not forfeiting my inheritance for the life to come) it had yet
been given me to live through this world to live a favoured
mortal under the old Olympian dispensation&mdash;to speak out my
resolves to <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>the listening Jove, and hear him answer with approving
thunder&mdash;to be blessed with divine councils from the lips of
Pallas Ath&#275;nie&mdash;to believe&mdash;ay, only to
believe&mdash;to believe for one rapturous moment that in the
gloomy depths of the grove, by the mountain&rsquo;s side, there
were some leafy pathway that crisped beneath the glowing sandal
of Aphrod&#275;tie&mdash;Aphrod&#275;tie, not coldly disdainful
of even a mortal&rsquo;s love!&nbsp; And this vain, heathenish
longing of mine was father to the thought of visiting the scene
of the ancient worship.</p>
<p>The isle is beautiful.&nbsp; From the edge of the rich,
flowery fields on which I trod to the midway sides of the snowy
Olympus, the ground could only here and there show an abrupt
crag, or a high straggling ridge that up-shouldered itself from
out of the wilderness of myrtles, and of the thousand
bright-leaved shrubs that twined their arms together in lovesome
tangles.&nbsp; The air that came to my lips was warm and fragrant
as the ambrosial breath of the goddess, infecting me, not (of
course) with a faith in the old religion of the isle, but with a
sense and apprehension of its mystic power&mdash;a power that was
still to be obeyed&mdash;obeyed by <i>me</i>, for why otherwise
did I toil on with sorry horses to &ldquo;where, for <span
class="smcap">her</span>, the hundred altars glowed with Arabian
incense, and breathed with the fragrance of garlands ever
fresh&rdquo;?&nbsp; <a name="citation77"></a><a
href="#footnote77" class="citation">[77]</a></p>
<p>I passed a sadly disenchanting night in the cabin of a Greek
priest&mdash;not a priest of the goddess, but of the Greek
Church; there was but one humble room, or rather shed, for man,
and priest, and beast.&nbsp; The next morning I reached Baffa
(Paphos), a <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>village not far distant from the site of the
temple.&nbsp; There was a Greek husbandman there who (not for
emolument, but for the sake of the protection and dignity which
it afforded) had got leave from the man at Limasol to hoist his
flag as a sort of deputy-provisionary-sub-vice-pro-acting-consul
of the British sovereign: the poor fellow instantly changed his
Greek headgear for the cap of consular dignity, and insisted upon
accompanying me to the ruins.&nbsp; I would not have stood this
if I could have felt the faintest gleam of my yesterday&rsquo;s
pagan piety, but I had ceased to dream, and had nothing to dread
from any new disenchanters.</p>
<p>The ruins (the fragments of one or two prostrate pillars) lie
upon a promontory, bare and unmystified by the gloom of
surrounding groves.&nbsp; My Greek friend in his consular cap
stood by, respectfully waiting to see what turn my madness would
take, now that I had come at last into the presence of the old
stones.&nbsp; If you have no taste for research, and can&rsquo;t
affect to look for inscriptions, there is some awkwardness in
coming to the end of a merely sentimental pilgrimage; when the
feeling which impelled you has gone, you have nothing to do but
to laugh the thing off as well as you can, and, by the bye, it is
not a bad plan to turn the conversation (or rather, allow the
natives to turn it) towards the subject of hidden
treasures.&nbsp; This is a topic on which they will always speak
with eagerness, and if they can fancy that you, too, take an
interest in such matters, they will not only think you perfectly
sane, but will begin to give you credit for some more than human
powers of forcing the obscure earth to show you its hoards of
gold.</p>
<p>When we returned to Baffa, the vice-consul seized <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>a club with
the quietly determined air of a brave man resolved to do some
deed of note.&nbsp; He went into the yard adjoining his cottage,
where there were some thin, thoughtful, canting cocks, and
serious, low-church-looking hens, respectfully listening, and
chickens of tender years so well brought up, as scarcely to
betray in their conduct the careless levity of youth.&nbsp; The
vice-consul stood for a moment quite calm, collecting his
strength; then suddenly he rushed into the midst of the
congregation, and began to deal death and destruction on all
sides.&nbsp; He spared neither sex nor age; the dead and dying
were immediately removed from the field of slaughter, and in less
than an hour, I think, they were brought on the table, deeply
buried in mounds of snowy rice.</p>
<p>My host was in all respects a fine, generous fellow.&nbsp; I
could not bear the idea of impoverishing him by my visit, and I
consulted my faithful Mysseri, who not only assured me that I
might safely offer money to the vice-consul, but recommended that
I should give no more to him than to &ldquo;the other,&rdquo;
meaning any other peasant.&nbsp; I felt, however, that there was
something about the man, besides the flag and the cap, which made
me shrink from offering coin, and as I mounted my horse on
departing I gave him the only thing fit for a present that I
happened to have with me, a rather handsome clasp-dagger, brought
from Vienna.&nbsp; The poor fellow was ineffably grateful, and I
had some difficulty in tearing myself from out of the reach of
his thanks.&nbsp; At last I gave him what I supposed to be the
last farewell, and rode on, but I had not gained more than about
a hundred yards when my host came bounding and shouting after me,
with a goat&rsquo;s-milk cheese in his hand, which he implored me
to accept.&nbsp; In old times the <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>shepherd of Theocritus, or (to speak
less dishonestly) the shepherd of the &ldquo;Poet&aelig;
Gr&aelig;ci,&rdquo; sung his best song; I in this latter age
presented my best dagger, and both of us received the same rustic
reward.</p>
<p>It had been known that I should return to Limasol, and when I
arrived there I found that a noble old Greek had been hospitably
plotting to have me for his guest.&nbsp; I willingly accepted his
offer.&nbsp; The day of my arrival happened to be the birthday of
my host, and in consequence of this there was a constant influx
of visitors, who came to offer their congratulations.&nbsp; A few
of these were men, but most of them were young, graceful
girls.&nbsp; Almost all of them went through the ceremony with
the utmost precision and formality; each in succession spoke her
blessing, in the tone of a person repeating a set formula, then
deferentially accepted the invitation to sit, partook of the
proffered sweetmeats and the cold, glittering water, remained for
a few minutes either in silence or engaged in very thin
conversation, then arose, delivered a second benediction,
followed by an elaborate farewell, and departed.</p>
<p>The bewitching power attributed at this day to the women of
Cyprus is curious in connection with the worship of the sweet
goddess, who called their isle her own.&nbsp; The Cypriote is
not, I think, nearly so beautiful in face as the Ionian queens of
Izmir, but she is tall, and slightly formed; there is a
high-souled meaning and expression, a seeming consciousness of
gentle empire, that speaks in the wavy line of the shoulder, and
winds itself like Cytherea&rsquo;s own cestus around the slender
waist; then the richly-abounding hair (not enviously gathered
together under the head-dress) descends the neck, and passes <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>the waist in
sumptuous braids.&nbsp; Of all other women with Grecian blood in
their veins the costume is graciously beautiful, but these, the
maidens of Limasol&mdash;their robes are more gently, more
sweetly imagined, and fall like Julia&rsquo;s cashmere in soft,
luxurious folds.&nbsp; The common voice of the Levant allows that
in face the women of Cyprus are less beautiful than their
brilliant sisters of Smyrna; and yet, says the Greek, he may
trust himself to one and all the bright cities of the
&AElig;gean, and may yet weigh anchor with a heart entire, but
that so surely as he ventures upon the enchanted isle of Cyprus,
so surely will he know the rapture or the bitterness of
love.&nbsp; The charm, they say, owes its power to that which the
people call the astonishing &ldquo;politics&rdquo;
(<i>&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&eta;</i>) of
the women, meaning, I fancy, their tact and their witching ways:
the word, however, plainly fails to express one half of that
which the speakers would say.&nbsp; I have smiled to hear the
Greek, with all his plenteousness of fancy, and all the wealth of
his generous language, yet vainly struggling to describe the
ineffable spell which the Parisians dispose of in their own smart
way by a summary &ldquo;Je ne s&ccedil;ai quoi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went to Larnaca, the chief city of the isle, and over the
water at last to Beyrout.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">LADY HESTER STANHOPE </span><a

class="citation">[82]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Beyrout</span> on its land side is hemmed
in by the Druses, who occupy all the neighbouring highlands.</p>
<p>Often enough I saw the ghostly images of the women with their
exalted horns stalking through the streets, and I saw too in
travelling the affrighted groups of the mountaineers as they fled
before me, under the fear that my party might be a company of
income-tax commissioners, or a press-gang enforcing the
conscription for Mehemet Ali; but nearly all my knowledge of the
people, except in regard of their mere costume and outward
appearance, is drawn from books and despatches, to which I have
the honour to refer you.</p>
<p>I received hospitable welcome at Beyrout from the Europeans as
well as from the Syrian Christians, and I soon discovered that
their standing topic of interest was the Lady Hester Stanhope,
who lived in an old <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>convent on the Lebanon range, at the distance of about a
day&rsquo;s journey from the town.&nbsp; The lady&rsquo;s habit
of refusing to see Europeans added the charm of mystery to a
character which, even without that aid, was sufficiently
distinguished to command attention.</p>
<p>Many years of Lady Hester&rsquo;s early womanhood had been
passed with Lady Chatham at Burton Pynsent, and during that
inglorious period of the heroine&rsquo;s life her commanding
character, and (as they would have called it in the language of
those days) her &ldquo;condescending kindness&rdquo; towards my
mother&rsquo;s family, had increased in them those strong
feelings of respect and attachment which her rank and station
alone would have easily won from people of the middle
class.&nbsp; You may suppose how deeply the quiet women in
Somersetshire must have been interested, when they slowly learned
by vague and uncertain tidings that the intrepid girl who had
been used to break their vicious horses for them was reigning in
sovereignty over the wandering tribes of Western Asia!&nbsp; I
know that her name was made almost as familiar to me in my
childhood as the name of Robinson Crusoe&mdash;both were
associated with the spirit of adventure; but whilst the imagined
life of the castaway mariner never failed to seem glaringly real,
the true story of the Englishwoman ruling over Arabs always
sounded to me like fable.&nbsp; I never had heard, nor indeed, I
believe, had the rest of the world ever heard, anything like a
certain account of the heroine&rsquo;s adventures; all I knew
was, that in one of the drawers which were the delight of my
childhood, along with attar of roses and fragrant wonders from
Hindustan, there were letters carefully treasured, and trifling
presents which I was taught to think valuable <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>because they
had come from the queen of the desert, who dwelt in tents, and
reigned over wandering Arabs.</p>
<p>This subject, however, died away, and from the ending of my
childhood up to the period of my arrival in the Levant, I had
seldom even heard a mentioning of the Lady Hester Stanhope, but
now, wherever I went, I was met by the name so familiar in sound,
and yet so full of mystery from the vague, fairy-tale sort of
idea which it brought to my mind; I heard it, too, connected with
fresh wonders, for it was said that the woman was now
acknowledged as an inspired being by the people of the mountains,
and it was even hinted with horror that she claimed to be <i>more
than a prophet</i>.</p>
<p>I felt at once that my mother would be sadly sorry to hear
that I had been within a day&rsquo;s ride of her early friend
without offering to see her, and I therefore despatched a letter
to the recluse, mentioning the maiden name of my mother (whose
marriage was subsequent to Lady Hester&rsquo;s departure), and
saying that if there existed on the part of her ladyship any wish
to hear of her old Somersetshire acquaintance, I should make a
point of visiting her.&nbsp; My letter was sent by a
foot-messenger, who was to take an unlimited time for his
journey, so that it was not, I think, until either the third or
the fourth day that the answer arrived.&nbsp; A couple of
horsemen covered with mud suddenly dashed into the little court
of the &ldquo;locanda&rdquo; in which I was staying, bearing
themselves as ostentatiously as though they were carrying a
cartel from the Devil to the Angel Michael: one of these (the
other being his attendant) was an Italian by birth (though now
completely orientalised), who lived in my lady&rsquo;s
establishment as doctor nominally, <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>but practically as an upper servant;
he presented me a very kind and appropriate letter of
invitation.</p>
<p>It happened that I was rather unwell at this time, so that I
named a more distant day for my visit than I should otherwise
have done, and after all, I did not start at the time
fixed.&nbsp; Whilst still remaining at Beyrout I received this
letter, which certainly betrays no symptom of the pretensions to
divine power which were popularly attributed to the
writer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I
hope I shall be disappointed in seeing you on Wednesday, for the
late rains have rendered the river Damoor if not dangerous, at
least very unpleasant to pass for a person who has been lately
indisposed, for if the animal swims, you would be immerged in the
waters.&nbsp; The weather will probably change after the 21st of
the moon, and after a couple of days the roads and the river will
be passable, therefore I shall expect you either Saturday or
Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a great satisfaction to me to have an
opportunity of inquiring after your mother, who was a sweet,
lovely girl when I knew her.&mdash;Believe me, sir, yours
sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Hester Lucy
Stanhope</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Early one morning I started from Beyrout.&nbsp; There are no
regularly established relays of horses in Syria, at least not in
the line which I took, and you therefore hire your cattle for the
whole journey, or at all events for your journey to some large
town.&nbsp; Under these circumstances you have no occasion for a
Tatar (whose principal utility consists in his power to compel
the supply of horses).&nbsp; In other respects, the mode of
travelling through Syria differs very little from that which I
have described as prevailing in Turkey.&nbsp; I hired my horses
and mules (for I had some of both) for the whole of the journey
from Beyrout to Jerusalem.&nbsp; The owner of the beasts <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>(who had a
couple of fellows under him) was the most dignified member of my
party; he was, indeed, a magnificent old man, and was called
Shereef, or &ldquo;holy&rdquo;&mdash;a title of honour which,
with the privilege of wearing the green turban, he well deserved,
not only from the blood of the Prophet that flowed in his veins,
but from the well-known sanctity of his life and the length of
his blessed beard.</p>
<p>Mysseri, of course, still travelled with me, but the Arabic
was not one of the seven languages which he spoke so perfectly,
and I was therefore obliged to hire another interpreter.&nbsp; I
had no difficulty in finding a proper man for the
purpose&mdash;one Demetrius, or, as he was always called,
Dthemetri, a native of Zante, who had been tossed about by
fortune in all directions.&nbsp; He spoke the Arabic very well,
and communicated with me in Italian.&nbsp; The man was a very
zealous member of the Greek Church.&nbsp; He had been a
tailor.&nbsp; He was as ugly as the devil, having a thoroughly
Tatar countenance, which expressed the agony of his body or mind,
as the case might be, in the most ludicrous manner
imaginable.&nbsp; He embellished the natural caricature of his
person by suspending about his neck and shoulders and waist
quantities of little bundles and parcels, which he thought too
valuable to be entrusted to the jerking of pack-saddles.&nbsp;
The mule that fell to his lot on this journey every now and then,
forgetting that his rider was a saint, and remembering that he
was a tailor, took a quiet roll upon the ground, and stretched
his limbs calmly and lazily, like a good man awaiting a
sermon.&nbsp; Dthemetri never got seriously hurt, but the
subversion and dislocation of his bundles made him for the moment
a sad spectacle of ruin, and when he <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>regained his legs, his wrath with the
mule became very amusing.&nbsp; He always addressed the beast in
language which implied that he, as a Christian and saint, had
been personally insulted and oppressed by a Mahometan mule.&nbsp;
Dthemetri, however, on the whole proved to be a most able and
capital servant.&nbsp; I suspected him of now and then leading me
out of my way in order that he might have the opportunity of
visiting the shrine of a saint; and on one occasion, as you will
see by and by, he was induced by religious motives to commit a
gross breach of duty; but putting these pious faults out of the
question (and they were faults of the right side), he was always
faithful and true to me.</p>
<p>I left Sa&iuml;de (the Sidon of ancient times) on my right,
and about an hour, I think, before sunset began to ascend one of
the many low hills of Lebanon.&nbsp; On the summit before me was
a broad, grey mass of irregular building, which from its
position, as well as from the gloomy blankness of its walls, gave
the idea of a neglected fortress.&nbsp; It had, in fact, been a
convent of great size, and like most of the religious houses in
this part of the world, had been made strong enough for opposing
an inert resistance to any mere casual band of assailants who
might be unprovided with regular means of attack: this was the
dwelling-place of the Chatham&rsquo;s fiery granddaughter.</p>
<p>The aspect of the first court which I entered was such as to
keep one in the idea of having to do with a fortress rather than
a mere peaceable dwelling-place.&nbsp; A number of fierce-looking
and ill-clad Albanian soldiers were hanging about the place, and
striving to bear the curse of tranquillity as well as they could:
two or three of them, I think, were smoking their
<i>tchibouques</i>, but the rest of them were <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>lying
torpidly upon the flat stones, like the bodies of departed
brigands.&nbsp; I rode on to an inner part of the building, and
at last, quitting my horses, was conducted through a doorway that
led me at once from an open court into an apartment on the ground
floor.&nbsp; As I entered, an Oriental figure in male costume
approached me from the farther end of the room with many and
profound bows, but the growing shades of evening prevented me
from distinguishing the features of the personage who was
receiving me with this solemn welcome.&nbsp; I had always,
however, understood that Lady Hester Stanhope wore the male
attire, and I began to utter in English the common civilities
that seemed to be proper on the commencement of a visit by an
uninspired mortal to a renowned prophetess; but the figure which
I addressed only bowed so much the more, prostrating itself
almost to the ground, but speaking to me never a word.&nbsp; I
feebly strived not to be outdone in gestures of respect; but
presently my bowing opponent saw the error under which I was
acting, and suddenly convinced me that, at all events, I was not
<i>yet</i> in the presence of a superhuman being, by declaring
that he was not &ldquo;miladi,&rdquo; but was, in fact, nothing
more or less god-like than the poor doctor, who had brought his
mistress&rsquo;s letter to Beyrout.</p>
<p>Her ladyship, in the right spirit of hospitality, now sent and
commanded me to repose for a while after the fatigues of my
journey, and to dine.</p>
<p>The cuisine was of the Oriental kind, which is highly
artificial, and I thought it very good.&nbsp; I rejoiced too in
the wine of the Lebanon.</p>
<p>Soon after the ending of the dinner the doctor arrived with
miladi&rsquo;s compliments, and an intimation that she would be
happy to receive me if I were so <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>disposed.&nbsp; It had now grown
dark, and the rain was falling heavily, so that I got rather wet
in following my guide through the open courts that I had to pass
in order to reach the presence chamber.&nbsp; At last I was
ushered into a small apartment, which was protected from the
draughts of air passing through the doorway by a folding screen;
passing this, I came alongside of a common European sofa, where
sat the lady prophetess.&nbsp; She rose from her seat very
formally, spoke to me a few words of welcome, pointed to a chair
which was placed exactly opposite to her sofa at a couple of
yards&rsquo; distance, and remained standing up to the full of
her majestic height, perfectly still and motionless, until I had
taken my appointed place; she then resumed her seat, not packing
herself up according to the mode of the Orientals, but allowing
her feet to rest on the floor or the footstool; at the moment of
seating herself she covered her lap with a mass of loose white
drapery which she held in her hand.&nbsp; It occurred to me at
the time that she did this in order to avoid the awkwardness of
sitting in manifest trousers under the eye of a European, but I
can hardly fancy now that with her wilful nature she would have
brooked such a compromise as this.</p>
<p>The woman before me had exactly the person of a
prophetess&mdash;not, indeed, of the divine sibyl imagined by
Domenichino, so sweetly distracted betwixt love and mystery, but
of a good business-like, practical prophetess, long used to the
exercise of her sacred calling.&nbsp; I have been told by those
who knew Lady Hester Stanhope in her youth, that any notion of a
resemblance betwixt her and the great Chatham must have been
fanciful; but at the time of my seeing her, the large commanding
features <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>of the gaunt woman, then sixty years old or more,
certainly reminded me of the statesman that lay dying <a
name="citation90a"></a><a href="#footnote90a"
class="citation">[90a]</a> in the House of Lords, according to
Copley&rsquo;s picture.&nbsp; Her face was of the most
astonishing whiteness; <a name="citation90b"></a><a
href="#footnote90b" class="citation">[90b]</a> she wore a very
large turban, which seemed to be of pale cashmere shawls, so
disposed as to conceal the hair; her dress, from the chin down to
the point at which it was concealed by the drapery which she held
over her lap, was a mass of white linen loosely folding&mdash;an
ecclesiastical sort of affair, more like a surplice than any of
those blessed creations which our souls love under the names of
&ldquo;dress&rdquo; and &ldquo;frock&rdquo; and
&ldquo;bodice&rdquo; and &ldquo;collar&rdquo; and
&ldquo;habit-shirt&rdquo; and sweet &ldquo;chemisette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the outward seeming of the personage that sat before
me, and indeed she was almost bound by the fame of her actual
achievements, as well as by her sublime pretensions, to look a
little differently from the rest of womankind.&nbsp; There had
been something of grandeur in her career.&nbsp; After the death
of Lady Chatham, which happened in 1803, she lived under the roof
of her uncle, the second Pitt, and when he resumed the Government
in 1804, she became the dispenser of much patronage, and sole
secretary of state for the department of Treasury banquets.&nbsp;
Not having seen the lady until late in her life, when she was
fired with spiritual ambition, I can hardly fancy that she could
have performed her political duties in the saloons of the
Minister with much of feminine sweetness and patience.&nbsp; I am
told, however, that she managed matters very well indeed: perhaps
it was better for the lofty-minded <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>leader of the House to have his
reception-rooms guarded by this stately creature, than by a
merely clever and managing woman; it was fitting that the
wholesome awe with which he filled the minds of the country
gentlemen should be aggravated by the presence of his majestic
niece.&nbsp; But the end was approaching.&nbsp; The sun of
Austerlitz showed the Czar madly sliding his splendid army like a
weaver&rsquo;s shuttle from his right hand to his left, under the
very eyes&mdash;the deep, grey, watchful eyes of Napoleon; before
night came, the coalition was a vain thing&mdash;meet for
history, and the heart of its great author was crushed with grief
when the terrible tidings came to his ears.&nbsp; In the
bitterness of his despair he cried out to his niece, and bid her
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Roll up the map of
Europe</span>&rdquo;; there was a little more of suffering, and
at last, with his swollen tongue (so they say) still muttering
something for England, he died by the noblest of all sorrows.</p>
<p>Lady Hester, meeting the calamity in her own fierce way, seems
to have scorned the poor island that had not enough of
God&rsquo;s grace to keep the &ldquo;heaven-sent&rdquo; Minister
alive.&nbsp; I can hardly tell why it should be, but there is a
longing for the East very commonly felt by proud-hearted people
when goaded by sorrow.&nbsp; Lady Hester Stanhope obeyed this
impulse.&nbsp; For some time, I believe, she was at
Constantinople, where her magnificence and near alliance to the
late Minister gained her great influence.&nbsp; Afterwards she
passed into Syria.&nbsp; The people of that country, excited by
the achievements of Sir Sidney Smith, had begun to imagine the
possibility of their land being occupied by the English, and many
of them looked upon Lady Hester as a princess who came to prepare
the way for the expected <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>conquest.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know it
from her own lips, or indeed from any certain authority, but I
have been told that she began her connection with the Bedouins by
making a large present of money (&pound;500 it was
said&mdash;immense in piastres) to the Sheik whose authority was
recognised in that part of the desert which lies between Damascus
and Palmyra.&nbsp; The prestige created by the rumours of her
high and undefined rank, as well as of her wealth and
corresponding magnificence, was well sustained by her imperious
character and her dauntless bravery.&nbsp; Her influence
increased.&nbsp; I never heard anything satisfactory as to the
real extent or duration of her sway, but it seemed that for a
time at least she certainly exercised something like sovereignty
amongst the wandering tribes. <a name="citation92"></a><a
href="#footnote92" class="citation">[92]</a>&nbsp; And now that
her earthly kingdom had passed away she strove for spiritual
power, and impiously dared, as it was said, to boast some mystic
union with the very God of very God!</p>
<p>A couple of black slave girls came at a signal, and supplied
their mistress as well as myself with lighted <i>tchibouques</i>
and coffee.</p>
<p>The custom of the East sanctions, and almost commands, some
moments of silence whilst you are inhaling the first few breaths
of the fragrant pipe.&nbsp; The pause was broken, I think, by my
lady, who addressed to me some inquiries respecting my mother,
and particularly as to her marriage; but before I <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>had
communicated any great amount of family facts, the spirit of the
prophetess kindled within her, and presently (though with all the
skill of a woman of the world) she shuffled away the subject of
poor, dear Somersetshire, and bounded onward into loftier spheres
of thought.</p>
<p>My old acquaintance with some of &ldquo;the twelve&rdquo;
enabled me to bear my part (of course a very humble one) in a
conversation relative to occult science.&nbsp; Milnes once spread
a report, that every gang of gipsies was found upon inquiry to
have come last from a place to the westward, and to be about to
make the next move in an eastern direction; either therefore they
were to be all gathered together towards the rising of the sun by
the mysterious finger of Providence, or else they were to revolve
round the globe for ever and ever: both of these suppositions
were highly gratifying, because they were both marvellous; and
though the story on which they were founded plainly sprang from
the inventive brain of a poet, no one had ever been so odiously
statistical as to attempt a contradiction of it.&nbsp; I now
mentioned the story as a report to Lady Hester Stanhope, and
asked her if it were true.&nbsp; I could not have touched upon
any imaginable subject more deeply interesting to my hearer, more
closely akin to her habitual train of thinking.&nbsp; She
immediately threw off all the restraint belonging to an interview
with a stranger; and when she had received a few more similar
proofs of my aptness for the marvellous, she went so far as to
say that she would adopt me as her <i>&eacute;l&egrave;ve</i> in
occult science.</p>
<p>For hours and hours this wondrous white woman poured forth her
speech, for the most part concerning sacred and profane
mysteries; but every now and <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>then she would stay her lofty flight
and swoop down upon the world again.&nbsp; Whenever this happened
I was interested in her conversation.</p>
<p>She adverted more than once to the period of her lost sway
amongst the Arabs, and mentioned some of the circumstances that
aided her in obtaining influence with the wandering tribes.&nbsp;
The Bedouin, so often engaged in irregular warfare, strains his
eyes to the horizon in search of a coming enemy just as
habitually as the sailor keeps his &ldquo;bright look-out&rdquo;
for a strange sail.&nbsp; In the absence of telescopes a
far-reaching sight is highly valued, and Lady Hester possessed
this quality to an extraordinary degree.&nbsp; She told me that
on one occasion, when there was good reason to expect a hostile
attack, great excitement was felt in the camp by the report of a
far-seeing Arab, who declared that he could just distinguish some
moving objects upon the very farthest point within the reach of
his eyes.&nbsp; Lady Hester was consulted, and she instantly
assured her comrades in arms that there were indeed a number of
horses within sight, but that they were without riders.&nbsp; The
assertion proved to be correct, and from that time forth her
superiority over all others in respect of far sight remained
undisputed.</p>
<p>Lady Hester related to me this other anecdote of her Arab
life.&nbsp; It was when the heroic qualities of the Englishwoman
were just beginning to be felt amongst the people of the desert,
that she was marching one day, along with the forces of the tribe
to which she had allied herself.&nbsp; She perceived that
preparations for an engagement were going on, and upon her making
inquiry as to the cause, the Sheik at first affected mystery and
concealment, but at last confessed that war had been declared
against his <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>tribe on account of its alliance with the English
princess, and that they were now unfortunately about to be
attacked by a very superior force.&nbsp; He made it appear that
Lady Hester was the sole cause of hostility betwixt his tribe and
the impending enemy, and that his sacred duty of protecting the
Englishwoman whom he had admitted as his guest was the only
obstacle which prevented an amicable arrangement of the
dispute.&nbsp; The Sheik hinted that his tribe was likely to
sustain an almost overwhelming blow, but at the same time
declared, that no fear of the consequences, however terrible to
him and his whole people, should induce him to dream of
abandoning his illustrious guest.&nbsp; The heroine instantly
took her part: it was not for her to be a source of danger to her
friends, but rather to her enemies, so she resolved to turn away
from the people, and trust for help to none save only her haughty
self.&nbsp; The Sheiks affected to dissuade her from so rash a
course, and fairly told her that although they (having been freed
from her presence) would be able to make good terms for
themselves, yet that there were no means of allaying the
hostility felt towards her, and that the whole face of the desert
would be swept by the horsemen of her enemies so carefully as to
make her escape into other districts almost impossible.&nbsp; The
brave woman was not to be moved by terrors of this kind, and
bidding farewell to the tribe which had honoured and protected
her, she turned her horse&rsquo;s head and rode straight away
from them, without friend or follower.&nbsp; Hours had elapsed,
and for some time she had been alone in the centre of the round
horizon, when her quick eye perceived some horsemen in the
distance.&nbsp; The party came nearer and nearer; soon it was
plain that they were making towards her, <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>and presently
some hundreds of Bedouins, fully armed, galloped up to her,
ferociously shouting, and apparently intending to take her life
at the instant with their pointed spears.&nbsp; Her face at the
time was covered with the <i>yashmak</i>, according to Eastern
usage, but at the moment when the foremost of the horsemen had
all but reached her with their spears, she stood up in her
stirrups, withdrew the <i>yashmak</i> that veiled the terrors of
her countenance, waved her arm slowly and disdainfully, and cried
out with a loud voice &ldquo;Avaunt!&rdquo; <a
name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a>&nbsp; The horsemen recoiled from her
glance, but not in terror.&nbsp; The threatening yells of the
assailants were suddenly changed for loud shouts of joy and
admiration at the bravery of the stately Englishwoman, and
festive gunshots were fired on all sides around her honoured
head.&nbsp; The truth was, that the party belonged to the tribe
with which she had allied herself, and that the threatened attack
as well as the pretended apprehension of an engagement had been
contrived for the mere purpose of testing her courage.&nbsp; The
day ended in a great feast prepared to do honour to the heroine,
and from that time her power over the minds of the people grew
rapidly.&nbsp; Lady Hester related this story with great spirit,
and I recollect that she put up her <i>yashmak</i> for a moment
in order to give me a better idea of the effect which she
produced by suddenly revealing the awfulness of her
countenance.</p>
<p>With respect to her then present mode of life, Lady Hester
informed me, that for her sin she had subjected herself during
many years to severe penance, <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>and that her self-denial had not been
without its reward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vain and false,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;is all the pretended knowledge of the
Europeans&mdash;their doctors will tell you that the drinking of
milk gives yellowness to the complexion; milk is my only food,
and you see if my face be not white.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her abstinence
from food intellectual was carried as far as her physical
fasting.&nbsp; She never, she said, looked upon a book or a
newspaper, but trusted alone to the stars for her sublime
knowledge; she usually passed the nights in communing with these
heavenly teachers, and lay at rest during the daytime.&nbsp; She
spoke with great contempt of the frivolity and benighted
ignorance of the modern Europeans, and mentioned in proof of
this, that they were not only untaught in astrology, but were
unacquainted with the common and every-day phenomena produced by
magic art.&nbsp; She spoke as if she would make me understand
that all sorcerous spells were completely at her command, but
that the exercise of such powers would be derogatory to her high
rank in the heavenly kingdom.&nbsp; She said that the spell by
which the face of an absent person is thrown upon a mirror was
within the reach of the humblest and most contemptible magicians,
but that the practice of such-like arts was unholy as well as
vulgar.</p>
<p>We spoke of the bending twig by which, it is said, precious
metals may be discovered.&nbsp; In relation to this, the
prophetess told me a story rather against herself, and
inconsistent with the notion of her being perfect in her science;
but I think that she mentioned the facts as having happened
before the time at which she attained to the great spiritual
authority which she now arrogated.&nbsp; She told me that vast
treasures were known to exist in a <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>situation which she mentioned, if I
rightly remember, as being near Suez; that Napoleon, profanely
brave, thrust his arm into the cave containing the coveted gold,
and that instantly his flesh became palsied, but the youthful
hero (for she said he was great in his generation) was not to be
thus daunted; he fell back characteristically upon his brazen
resources, and ordered up his artillery; but man could not strive
with demons, and Napoleon was foiled.&nbsp; In after years came
Ibrahim Pasha, with heavy guns, and wicked spells to boot, but
the infernal guardians of the treasure were too strong for
him.&nbsp; It was after this that Lady Hester passed by the spot,
and she described with animated gesture the force and energy with
which the divining twig had suddenly leaped in her hands.&nbsp;
She ordered excavations, and no demons opposed her enterprise;
the vast chest in which the treasure had been deposited was at
length discovered, but, lo and behold, it was full of
pebbles!&nbsp; She said, however, that the times were approaching
in which the hidden treasures of the earth would become available
to those who had true knowledge.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ibrahim Pasha, Lady Hester said that he was a
bold, bad man, and was possessed of some of those common and
wicked magical arts upon which she looked down with so much
contempt.&nbsp; She said, for instance, that Ibrahim&rsquo;s life
was charmed against balls and steel, and that after a battle he
loosened the folds of his shawl and shook out the bullets like
dust.</p>
<p>It seems that the St. Simonians once made overtures to Lady
Hester.&nbsp; She told me that the P&egrave;re Enfantin (the
chief of the sect) had sent her a service of plate, but that she
had declined to receive <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>it.&nbsp; She delivered a prediction
as to the probability of the St. Simonians finding the
&ldquo;mystic mother,&rdquo; and this she did in a way which
would amuse you.&nbsp; Unfortunately I am not at liberty to
mention this part of the woman&rsquo;s prophecies; why, I cannot
tell, but so it is, that she bound me to eternal secrecy.</p>
<p>Lady Hester told me that since her residence at Djoun she had
been attacked by a terrible illness, which rendered her for a
long time perfectly helpless; all her attendants fled, and left
her to perish.&nbsp; Whilst she lay thus alone, and quite unable
to rise, robbers came and carried away her property. <a
name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99"
class="citation">[99]</a>&nbsp; She told me that they actually
unroofed a great part of the building, and employed engines with
pulleys, for the purpose of hoisting out such of her valuables as
were too bulky to pass through doors.&nbsp; It would seem that
before this catastrophe Lady Hester had been rich in the
possession of Eastern luxuries; for she told me that when the
chiefs of the Ottoman force took refuge with her after the fall
of Acre, they brought their wives also in great <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>numbers.&nbsp; To all of these Lady Hester, as she
said, presented magnificent dresses; but her generosity
occasioned strife only instead of gratitude, for every woman who
fancied her present less splendid than that of another with equal
or less pretension, became absolutely furious: all these
audacious guests had now been got rid of, but the Albanian
soldiers, who had taken refuge with Lady Hester at the same time,
still remained under her protection.</p>
<p>In truth, this half-ruined convent, guarded by the proud heart
of an English gentlewoman, was the only spot throughout all Syria
and Palestine in which the will of Mehemet Ali and his fierce
lieutenant was not the law.&nbsp; More than once had the Pasha of
Egypt commanded that Ibrahim should have the Albanians delivered
up to him, but this white woman of the mountain (grown classical
not by books, but by very pride) answered only with a disdainful
invitation to &ldquo;come and take them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether it
was that Ibrahim was acted upon by any superstitious dread of
interfering with the prophetess (a notion not at all incompatible
with his character as an able Oriental commander), or that he
feared the ridicule of putting himself in collision with a
gentlewoman, he certainly never ventured to attack the sanctuary,
and so long as the Chatham&rsquo;s granddaughter breathed a
breath of life there was always this one hillock, and that too in
the midst of a most populous district, which stood out, and kept
its freedom.&nbsp; Mehemet Ali used to say, I am told, that the
Englishwoman had given him more trouble than all the insurgent
people of Syria and Palestine.</p>
<p>The prophetess announced to me that we were upon the eve of a
stupendous convulsion, which would destroy the then recognised
value of all <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>property upon earth; and declaring that those only who
should be in the East at the time of the great change could hope
for greatness in the new life that was now close at hand, she
advised me, whilst there was yet time, to dispose of my property
in poor frail England, and gain a station in Asia.&nbsp; She told
me that, after leaving her, I should go into Egypt, but that in a
little while I should return into Syria.&nbsp; I secretly smiled
at this last prophecy as a &ldquo;bad shot,&rdquo; for I had
fully determined after visiting the Pyramids to take ship from
Alexandria for Greece.&nbsp; But men struggle vainly in the
meshes of their destiny.&nbsp; The unbelieved Cassandra was right
after all; the plague came, and the necessity of avoiding the
quarantine, to which I should have been subjected if I had sailed
from Alexandria, forced me to alter my route.&nbsp; I went down
into Egypt, and stayed there for a time, and then crossed the
desert once more, and came back to the mountains of the Lebanon,
exactly as the prophetess had foretold.</p>
<p>Lady Hester talked to me long and earnestly on the subject of
religion, announcing that the Messiah was yet to come.&nbsp; She
strived to impress me with the vanity and the falseness of all
European creeds, as well as with a sense of her own spiritual
greatness: throughout her conversation upon these high topics she
carefully insinuated, without actually asserting, her heavenly
rank.</p>
<p>Amongst other much more marvellous powers, the lady claimed to
have one which most women, I fancy, possess, namely, that of
reading men&rsquo;s characters in their faces.&nbsp; She examined
the line of my features very attentively, and told me the result,
which, however, I mean to keep hidden.</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>One
favoured subject of discourse was that of &ldquo;race,&rdquo;
upon which she was very diffuse, and yet rather mysterious.&nbsp;
She set great value upon the ancient French <a
name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102"
class="citation">[102]</a> (not Norman blood, for that she
vilified), but did not at all appreciate that which we call in
this country &ldquo;an old family.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had a vast
idea of the Cornish miners on account of their race, and said, if
she chose, she could give me the means of rousing them to the
most tremendous enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Such are the topics on which the lady mainly conversed, but
very often she would descend to more worldly chat, and then she
was no longer the prophetess, but the sort of woman that you
sometimes see, I am told, in London drawing-rooms&mdash;cool,
decisive in manner, unsparing of enemies, full of audacious fun,
and saying the downright things that the sheepish society around
her is afraid to utter.&nbsp; I am told that Lady Hester was in
her youth a capital mimic, and she showed me that not all the
queenly dullness to which she had condemned herself, not all her
fasting and solitude, had destroyed this terrible power.&nbsp;
The first whom she crucified in my presence was poor Lord
Byron.&nbsp; She had seen him, it appeared, I know not where,
soon after his arrival in the East, and was vastly amused at his
little <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>affectations.&nbsp; He had picked up a few sentences of
the Romanic, with which he affected to give orders to his Greek
servant.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell whether Lady Hester&rsquo;s
mimicry of the bard was at all close, but it was amusing; she
attributed to him a curiously coxcombical lisp.</p>
<p>Another person whose style of speaking the lady took off very
amusingly was one who would scarcely object to suffer by the side
of Lord Byron&mdash;I mean Lamartine, who had visited her in the
course of his travels.&nbsp; The peculiarity which attracted her
ridicule was an over-refinement of manner: according to my
lady&rsquo;s imitation of Lamartine (I have never seen him
myself), he had none of the violent grimace of his countrymen,
and not even their usual way of talking, but rather bore himself
mincingly, like the humbler sort of English dandy. <a
name="citation103"></a><a href="#footnote103"
class="citation">[103]</a></p>
<p>Lady Hester seems to have heartily despised everything
approaching to exquisiteness.&nbsp; She told me, by the bye (and
her opinion upon that subject is worth having), that a downright
manner, amounting even to brusqueness, is more effective than any
other with the Oriental; and that amongst the English of all
ranks and all classes there is no man so attractive to the
Orientals, no man who can negotiate with <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>them half
so effectively, as a good, honest, open-hearted, and positive
naval officer of the old school.</p>
<p>I have told you, I think, that Lady Hester could deal fiercely
with those she hated.&nbsp; One man above all others (he is now
uprooted from society, and cast away for ever) she blasted with
her wrath.&nbsp; You would have thought that in the scornfulness
of her nature she must have sprung upon her foe with more of
fierceness than of skill; but this was not so, for with all the
force and vehemence of her invective she displayed a sober,
patient, and minute attention to the details of vituperation,
which contributed to its success a thousand times more than mere
violence.</p>
<p>During the hours that this sort of conversation, or rather
discourse, was going on our <i>tchibouques</i> were from time to
time replenished, and the lady as well as I continued to smoke
with little or no intermission till the interview ended.&nbsp; I
think that the fragrant fumes of the latakiah must have helped to
keep me on my good behaviour as a patient disciple of the
prophetess.</p>
<p>It was not till after midnight that my visit for the evening
came to an end.&nbsp; When I quitted my seat the lady rose and
stood up in the same formal attitude (almost that of a soldier in
a state of &ldquo;attention&rdquo;) which she had assumed at my
entrance; at the same time she let go the drapery which she had
held over her lap whilst sitting and allowed it to fall to the
ground.</p>
<p>The next morning after breakfast I was visited by my
lady&rsquo;s secretary&mdash;the only European, except the
doctor, whom she retained in her household.&nbsp; This secretary,
like the doctor, was Italian, but he preserved more signs of
European dress and European <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>pretensions than his medical
fellow-slave.&nbsp; He spoke little or no English, though he
wrote it pretty well, having been formerly employed in a
mercantile house connected with England.&nbsp; The poor fellow
was in an unhappy state of mind.&nbsp; In order to make you
understand the extent of his spiritual anxieties, I ought to have
told you that the doctor <a name="citation105"></a><a
href="#footnote105" class="citation">[105]</a> (who had sunk into
the complete Asiatic, and had condescended accordingly to the
performance of even menial services) had adopted the common faith
of all the neighbouring people, and had become a firm and happy
believer in the divine power of his mistress.&nbsp; Not so the
secretary.&nbsp; When I had strolled with him to a distance from
the building, which rendered him safe from being overheard by
human ears, he told me in a hollow voice, trembling with emotion,
that there were times at which he doubted the divinity of
&ldquo;mil&egrave;di.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said nothing to encourage
the poor fellow in that frightful state of scepticism which, if
indulged, might end in positive infidelity.&nbsp; I found that
her ladyship had rather arbitrarily abridged the amusements of
her secretary, forbidding him from shooting small birds on the
mountain-side.&nbsp; This oppression had aroused in him a spirit
of inquiry that might end fatally, perhaps for himself, perhaps
for the &ldquo;religion of the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary told me that his mistress was greatly disliked
by the surrounding people, whom she oppressed by her exactions,
and the truth of this <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>statement was borne out by the way
in which my lady spoke to me of her neighbours.&nbsp; But in
Eastern countries hate and veneration are very commonly felt for
the same object, and the general belief in the superhuman power
of this wonderful white lady, her resolute and imperious
character, and above all, perhaps, her fierce Albanians (not
backward to obey an order for the sacking of a village), inspired
sincere respect amongst the surrounding inhabitants.&nbsp; Now
the being &ldquo;respected&rdquo; amongst Orientals is not an
empty or merely honorary distinction, but carries with it a clear
right to take your neighbour&rsquo;s corn, his cattle, his eggs,
and his honey, and almost anything that is his, except his
wives.&nbsp; This law was acted upon by the princess of Djoun,
and her establishment was supplied by contributions apportioned
amongst the nearest of the villages.</p>
<p>I understood that the Albanians (restrained, I suppose, by the
dread of being delivered up to Ibrahim) had not given any very
troublesome proofs of their unruly natures.&nbsp; The secretary
told me that their rations, including a small allowance of coffee
and tobacco, were served out to them with tolerable
regularity.</p>
<p>I asked the secretary how Lady Hester was off for horses, and
said that I would take a look at the stable.&nbsp; The man did
not raise any opposition to my proposal, and affected no mystery
about the matter, but said that the only two steeds which then
belonged to her ladyship were of a very humble sort.&nbsp; This
answer, and a storm of rain then beginning to descend, prevented
me at the time from undertaking my journey to the stable, which
was at some distance from the part of the building in which I was
quartered, and I don&rsquo;t know that I ever thought of <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>the matter
afterwards until my return to England, when I saw
Lamartine&rsquo;s eye-witnessing account of the horse saddled by
the hands of his Maker!</p>
<p>When I returned to my apartment (which, as my hostess told me,
was the only one in the whole building that kept out the rain)
her ladyship sent to say that she would be glad to receive me
again.&nbsp; I was rather surprised at this, for I had understood
that she reposed during the day, and it was now little later than
noon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said she, when I had taken my
seat and my pipe, &ldquo;we were together for hours last night,
and still I have heard nothing at all of my old friends; now
<i>do</i> tell me something of your dear mother and her sister; I
never knew your father&mdash;it was after I left Burton Pynsent
that your mother married.&rdquo;&nbsp; I began to make slow
answer, but my questioner soon went off again to topics more
sublime, so that this second interview, which lasted two or three
hours, was occupied by the same sort of varied discourse as that
which I have been describing.</p>
<p>In the course of the afternoon the captain of an English
man-of-war arrived at Djoun, and her ladyship determined to
receive him for the same reason as that which had induced her to
allow my visit, namely, an early intimacy with his family.&nbsp;
I and the new visitor, who was a pleasant, amusing person, dined
together, and we were afterwards invited to the presence of my
lady, with whom we sat smoking and talking till midnight.&nbsp;
The conversation turned chiefly, I think, upon magical
science.&nbsp; I had determined to be off at an early hour the
next morning, and so at the end of this interview I bade my lady
farewell.&nbsp; With her parting words she once more advised me
to abandon Europe and seek my reward in the East, and she urged
me too to give the <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>like counsels to my father, and tell him that
&ldquo;<i>She had said it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Hester&rsquo;s unholy claim to supremacy in the spiritual
kingdom was, no doubt, the suggestion of fierce and inordinate
pride most perilously akin to madness, but I am quite sure that
the mind of the woman was too strong to be thoroughly overcome by
even this potent feeling.&nbsp; I plainly saw that she was not an
unhesitating follower of her own system, and I even fancied that
I could distinguish the brief moments during which she contrived
to believe in herself, from those long and less happy intervals
in which her own reason was too strong for her.</p>
<p>As for the lady&rsquo;s faith in astrology and magic science,
you are not for a moment to suppose that this implied any
aberration of intellect.&nbsp; She believed these things in
common with those around her, for she seldom spoke to anybody
except crazy old dervishes, who received her alms, and fostered
her extravagancies, and even when (as on the occasion of my
visit) she was brought into contact with a person entertaining
different notions, she still remained uncontradicted.&nbsp; This
<i>entourage</i> and the habit of fasting from books and
newspapers were quite enough to make her a facile recipient of
any marvellous story.</p>
<p>I think that in England we are scarcely sufficiently conscious
of the great debt we owe to the wise and watchful press which
presides over the formation of our opinions, and which brings
about this splendid result, namely, that in matters of belief the
humblest of us are lifted up to the level of the most sagacious,
so that really a simple cornet in the Blues is no more likely to
entertain a foolish belief about ghosts or witchcraft, or any
other supernatural topic, than the Lord High Chancellor or the
Leader of the House <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>of Commons.&nbsp; How different is
the intellectual r&eacute;gime of Eastern countries!&nbsp; In
Syria and Palestine and Egypt you might as well dispute the
efficacy of grass or grain as of magic.&nbsp; There is no
controversy about the matter.&nbsp; The effect of this, the
unanimous belief of an ignorant people upon the mind of a
stranger, is extremely curious, and well worth noticing.&nbsp; A
man coming freshly from Europe is at first proof against the
nonsense with which he is assailed, but often it happens that
after a little while the social atmosphere in which he lives will
begin to infect him, and if he has been unaccustomed to the
cunning of fence by which Reason prepares the means of guarding
herself against fallacy, he will yield himself at last to the
faith of those around him, and this he will do by sympathy, it
would seem, rather than from conviction.&nbsp; I have been much
interested in observing that the mere &ldquo;practical
man,&rdquo; however skilful and shrewd in his own way, has not
the kind of power that will enable him to resist the gradual
impression made upon his mind by the common opinion of those whom
he sees and hears from day to day.&nbsp; Even amongst the English
(whose good sense and sound religious knowledge would be likely
to guard them from error) I have known the calculating merchant,
the inquisitive traveller, and the post-captain, with his bright,
wakeful eye of command&mdash;I have known all these surrender
themselves to the <i>really</i> magic-like influence of other
people&rsquo;s minds.&nbsp; Their language at first is that they
are &ldquo;staggered,&rdquo; leading you by that expression to
suppose that they had been witnesses to some phenomenon, which it
was very difficult to account for otherwise than by supernatural
causes; but when I have questioned further, I have always found
that these &ldquo;staggering&rdquo; wonders were not <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>even
specious enough to be looked upon as good
&ldquo;tricks.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man in England who gained his whole
livelihood as a conjurer would soon be starved to death if he
could perform no better miracles than those which are wrought
with so much effect in Syria and Egypt; <i>sometimes</i>, no
doubt, a magician will make a good hit (Sir John once said a
&ldquo;good thing&rdquo;), but all such successes range, of
course, under the head of mere &ldquo;tentative miracles,&rdquo;
as distinguished by the strong-brained Paley.</p>
<h2><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE SANCTUARY</span></h2>
<p>I crossed the plain of Esdraelon and entered amongst the hills
of beautiful Galilee.&nbsp; It was at sunset that my path brought
me sharply round into the gorge of a little valley, and close
upon a grey mass of dwellings that lay happily nestled in the lap
of the mountain.&nbsp; There was one only shining point still
touched with the light of the sun, who had set for all besides; a
brave sign this to &ldquo;holy&rdquo; Shereef and the rest of my
Moslem men, for the one glittering summit was the head of a
minaret, and the rest of the seeming village that had veiled
itself so meekly under the shades of evening was Christian
Nazareth!</p>
<p>Within the precincts of the Latin convent in which I was
quartered there stands the great Catholic church which encloses
the sanctuary, the dwelling of the blessed Virgin. <a
name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a>&nbsp; This is a grotto of about ten <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>feet either
way, forming a little chapel or recess, to which you descend by
steps.&nbsp; It is decorated with splendour.&nbsp; On the left
hand a column of granite hangs from the top of the grotto to
within a few feet of the ground; immediately beneath it is
another column of the same size, which rises from the ground as
if to meet the one above; but between this and the suspended
pillar there is an interval of more than a foot; these fragments
once formed a single column, against which the angel leant when
he spoke and told to Mary the mystery of her awful
blessedness.&nbsp; Hard by, near the altar, the holy Virgin was
kneeling.</p>
<p>I had been journeying (cheerily indeed, for the voices of my
followers were ever within my hearing, but yet), as it were, in
solitude, for I had no comrade to whet the edge of my reason, or
wake me from my noonday dreams.&nbsp; I was left all alone to be
taught and swayed by the beautiful circumstances of Palestine
travelling&mdash;by the clime, and the land, and the name of the
land, with all its mighty import; by the glittering freshness of
the sward, and the <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>abounding masses of flowers that furnished my sumptuous
pathway; by the bracing and fragrant air that seemed to poise me
in my saddle, and to lift me along as a planet appointed to glide
through space.</p>
<p>And the end of my journey was Nazareth, the home of the
blessed Virgin!&nbsp; In the first dawn of my manhood the old
painters of Italy had taught me their dangerous worship of the
beauty that is more than mortal, but those images all seemed
shadowy now, and floated before me so dimly, the one overcasting
the other, that they left me no one sweet idol on which I could
look and look again and say, &ldquo;Maria mia!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet
they left me more than an idol; they left me (for to them I am
wont to trace it) a faint apprehension of beauty not compassed
with lines and shadows; they touched me (forgive, proud Marie of
Anjou!)&mdash;they touched me with a faith in loveliness
transcending mortal shapes.</p>
<p>I came to Nazareth, and was led from the convent to the
sanctuary.&nbsp; Long fasting will sometimes heat my brain and
draw me away out of the world&mdash;will disturb my judgment,
confuse my notions of right and wrong, and weaken my power of
choosing the right: I had fasted perhaps too long, for I was
fevered with the zeal of an insane devotion to the heavenly queen
of Christendom.&nbsp; But I knew the feebleness of this gentle
malady, and knew how easily my watchful reason, if ever so
slightly provoked, would drag me back to life.&nbsp; Let there
but come one chilling breath of the outer world, and all this
loving piety would cower and fly before the sound of my own
bitter laugh.&nbsp; And so as I went I trod tenderly, not looking
to the right nor to the left, but bending my eyes to the
ground.</p>
<p>The attending friar served me well; he led me <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>down
quietly and all but silently to the Virgin&rsquo;s home.&nbsp;
The mystic air was so burnt with the consuming flames of the
altar, and so laden with incense, that my chest laboured
strongly, and heaved with luscious pain.&nbsp; There&mdash;there
with beating heart the Virgin knelt and listened.&nbsp; I strived
to grasp and hold with my riveted eyes some one of the feigned
Madonnas, but of all the heaven-lit faces imagined by men there
was none that would abide with me in this the very
sanctuary.&nbsp; Impatient of vacancy, I grew madly strong
against Nature, and if by some awful spell, some impious rite, I
could&mdash;Oh most sweet Religion, that bid me fear God, and be
pious, and yet not cease from loving!&nbsp; Religion and gracious
custom commanded me that I fall down loyally and kiss the rock
that blessed Mary pressed.&nbsp; With a half consciousness, with
the semblance of a thrilling hope that I was plunging deep, deep
into my first knowledge of some most holy mystery, or of some new
rapturous and daring sin, I knelt, and bowed down my face till I
met the smooth rock with my lips.&nbsp; One moment&mdash;one
moment my heart, or some old pagan demon within me, woke up, and
fiercely bounded; my bosom was lifted, and swung, as though I had
touched her warm robe.&nbsp; One moment, one more, and then the
fever had left me.&nbsp; I rose from my knees.&nbsp; I felt
hopelessly sane.&nbsp; The mere world reappeared.&nbsp; My good
old monk was there, dangling his key with listless patience, and
as he guided me from the church, and talked of the refectory and
the coming repast, I listened to his words with some attention
and pleasure.</p>
<h2><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE MONKS OF PALESTINE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Whenever</span> you come back to me from
Palestine we will find some &ldquo;golden wine&rdquo; <a
name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115"
class="citation">[115]</a> of Lebanon, that we may celebrate with
apt libations the monks of the Holy Land, and though the poor
fellows be theoretically &ldquo;dead to the world,&rdquo; we will
drink to every man of them a good long life, and a merry
one!&nbsp; Graceless is the traveller who forgets his obligations
to these saints upon earth; little love has he for merry
Christendom if he has not rejoiced with great joy to find in the
very midst of water-drinking infidels those lowly monasteries, in
which the blessed juice of the grape is quaffed in peace.&nbsp;
Ay! ay! we will fill our glasses till they look like cups of
amber, and drink profoundly to our gracious hosts in
Palestine.</p>
<p>Christianity permits, and sanctions, the drinking of wine, and
of all the holy brethren in Palestine there are none who hold
fast to this gladsome rite so strenuously as the monks of
Damascus; not that they are more zealous Christians than the rest
of their fellows in the Holy Land, but that they have better
wine.&nbsp; Whilst I was at Damascus I had my quarters at the
Franciscan convent there, and very soon after <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>my arrival
I asked one of the monks to let me know something of the spots
that deserved to be seen.&nbsp; I made my inquiry in reference to
the associations with which the city had been hallowed by the
sojourn and adventures of St. Paul.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is nothing
in all Damascus,&rdquo; said the good man, &ldquo;half so well
worth seeing as our cellars;&rdquo; and forthwith he invited me
to go, see, and admire the long range of liquid treasure that he
and his brethren had laid up for themselves on earth.&nbsp; And
these I soon found were not as the treasures of the miser, that
lie in unprofitable disuse; for day by day, and hour by hour, the
golden juice ascended from the dark recesses of the cellar to the
uppermost brains of the friars.&nbsp; Dear old fellows! in the
midst of that solemn land their Christian laughter rang loudly
and merrily, their eyes kept flashing with joyous bonfires, and
their heavy woollen petticoats could no more weigh down the
springiness of their paces, than the filmy gauze of a
<i>danseuse</i> can clog her bounding step.</p>
<p>You would be likely enough to fancy that these monastics are
men who have retired to the sacred sites of Palestine from an
enthusiastic longing to devote themselves to the exercise of
religion in the midst of the very land on which its first seeds
were cast; and this is partially, at least, the case with the
monks of the Greek Church, but it is not with enthusiasts that
the Catholic establishments are filled.&nbsp; The monks of the
Latin convents are chiefly persons of the peasant class from
Italy and Spain, who have been handed over to these remote
asylums by order of their ecclesiastical superiors, and can no
more account for their being in the Holy Land, than men of
marching regiments can explain why they are in &ldquo;stupid
quarters.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe that these monks are <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>for the
most part well conducted men, punctual in their ceremonial
duties, and altogether humble-minded Christians.&nbsp; Their
humility is not at all misplaced, for you see at a glance (poor
fellows!) that they belong to the <i>lag remove</i> of the human
race.&nbsp; If the taking of the cowl does not imply a complete
renouncement of the world, it is at least (in these days) a
thorough farewell to every kind of useful and entertaining
knowledge, and accordingly the low bestial brow and the animal
caste of those almost Bourbon features show plainly enough that
all the intellectual vanities of life have been really and truly
abandoned.&nbsp; But it is hard to quench altogether the spirit
of inquiry that stirs in the human breast, and accordingly these
monks inquire&mdash;they are <i>always</i>
inquiring&mdash;inquiring for &ldquo;news&rdquo;!&nbsp; Poor
fellows! they could scarcely have yielded themselves to the sway
of any passion more difficult of gratification, for they have no
means of communicating with the busy world except through
European travellers; and these, in consequence I suppose of that
restlessness and irritability that generally haunt their
wanderings, seem to have always avoided the bore of giving any
information to their hosts.&nbsp; As for me, I am more patient
and good-natured, and when I found that the kind monks who
gathered round me at Nazareth were longing to know the real truth
about the General Bonaparte who had recoiled from the siege of
Acre, I softened my heart down to the good humour of Herodotus,
and calmly began to &ldquo;sing history,&rdquo; telling my eager
hearers of the French Empire and the greatness of its glory, and
of Waterloo and the fall of Napoleon!&nbsp; Now my story of this
marvellous ignorance on the part of the poor monks is one upon
which (though depending on my <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>own testimony) I look &ldquo;with
considerable suspicion.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is quite true (how silly
it would be to invent anything so witless!), and yet I think I
could satisfy the mind of a &ldquo;reasonable man&rdquo; that it
is false.&nbsp; Many of the older monks must have been in Europe
at the time when the Italy and the Spain from which they came
were in act of taking their French lessons, or had parted so
lately with their teachers, that not to know of &ldquo;the
Emperor&rdquo; was impossible, and these men could scarcely,
therefore, have failed to bring with them some tidings of
Napoleon&rsquo;s career.&nbsp; Yet I say that that which I have
written is true&mdash;the one who believes because I have said it
will be right (she always is), whilst poor Mr. &ldquo;reasonable
man,&rdquo; who is convinced by the weight of my argument, will
be completely deceived.</p>
<p>In Spanish politics, however, the monks are better
instructed.&nbsp; The revenues of the monasteries, which had been
principally supplied by the bounty of their most Catholic
majesties, have been withheld since Ferdinand&rsquo;s death, and
the interests of these establishments being thus closely involved
in the destinies of Spain, it is not wonderful that the brethren
should be a little more knowing in Spanish affairs than in other
branches of history.&nbsp; Besides, a large proportion of the
monks were natives of the Peninsula.&nbsp; To these, I remember,
Mysseri&rsquo;s familiarity with the Spanish language and
character was a source of immense delight; they were always
gathering around him, and it seemed to me that they treasured
like gold the few Castilian words which he deigned to spare
them.</p>
<p>The monks do a world of good in their way; and there can be no
doubting that previously to the arrival of Bishop Alexander, with
his numerous <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>young family and his pretty English nursemaids, they
were the chief propagandists of Christianity in Palestine.&nbsp;
My old friends of the Franciscan convent at Jerusalem some time
since gave proof of their goodness by delivering themselves up to
the peril of death for the sake of duty.&nbsp; When I was their
guest they were forty I believe in number, and I don&rsquo;t
recollect that there was one of them whom I should have looked
upon as a desirable life-holder of any property to which I might
be entitled in expectancy.&nbsp; Yet these forty were reduced in
a few days to nineteen.&nbsp; The plague was the messenger that
summoned them to a taste of real death; but the circumstances
under which they perished are rather curious; and though I have
no authority for the story except an Italian newspaper, I harbour
no doubt of its truth, for the facts were detailed with
minuteness, and strictly corresponded with all that I knew of the
poor fellows to whom they related.</p>
<p>It was about three months after the time of my leaving
Jerusalem that the plague set his spotted foot on the Holy
City.&nbsp; The monks felt great alarm; they did not shrink from
their duty, but for its performance they chose a plan most sadly
well fitted for bringing down upon them the very death which they
were striving to ward off.&nbsp; They imagined themselves almost
safe so long as they remained within their walls; but then it was
quite needful that the Catholic Christians of the place, who had
always looked to the convent for the supply of their spiritual
wants, should receive the aids of religion in the hour of
death.&nbsp; A single monk therefore was chosen, either by lot or
by some other fair appeal to destiny.&nbsp; Being thus singled
out, he was to go forth into the plague-stricken city, and to
perform with exactness <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>his priestly duties; then he was to
return, not to the interior of the convent, for fear of infecting
his brethren, but to a detached building (which I remember)
belonging to the establishment, but at some little distance from
the inhabited rooms.&nbsp; He was provided with a bell, and at a
certain hour in the morning he was ordered to ring it, <i>if he
could</i>; but if no sound was heard at the appointed time, then
knew his brethren that he was either delirious or dead, and
another martyr was sent forth to take his place.&nbsp; In this
way twenty-one of the monks were carried off.&nbsp; One cannot
well fail to admire the steadiness with which the dismal scheme
was carried through; but if there be any truth in the notion that
disease may be invited by a frightening imagination, it is
difficult to conceive a more dangerous plan than that which was
chosen by these poor fellows.&nbsp; The anxiety with which they
must have expected each day the sound of the bell, the silence
that reigned instead of it, and then the drawing of the lots (the
odds against death being one point lower than yesterday), and the
going forth of the newly-doomed man&mdash;all this must have
widened the gulf that opens to the shades below.&nbsp; When his
victim had already suffered so much of mental torture, it was but
easy work for big bullying pestilence to follow a forlorn monk
from the beds of the dying, and wrench away his life from him as
he lay all alone in an outhouse.</p>
<p>In most, I believe in all, of the Holy Land convents there are
two personages so strangely raised above their brethren in all
that dignifies humanity, that their bearing the same habit, their
dwelling under the same roof, their worshipping the same God
(consistent as all this is with the spirit of their <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>religion),
yet strikes the mind with a sense of wondrous incongruity; the
men I speak of are the &ldquo;Padre Superiore,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Padre Missionario.&rdquo;&nbsp; The former is the supreme
and absolute governor of the establishment over which he is
appointed to rule, the latter is entrusted with the more active
of the spiritual duties attaching to the Pilgrim Church.&nbsp; He
is the shepherd of the good Catholic flock, whose pasture is
prepared in the midst of Mussulmans and schismatics; he keeps the
light of the true faith ever vividly before their eyes, reproves
their vices, supports them in their good resolves, consoles them
in their afflictions, and teaches them to hate the Greek
Church.&nbsp; Such are his labours, and you may conceive that
great tact must be needed for conducting with success the
spiritual interests of the Church under circumstances so odd as
those which surround it in Palestine.</p>
<p>But the position of the Padre Superiore is still more
delicate; he is almost unceasingly in treaty with the powers that
be, and the worldly prosperity of the establishment over which he
presides is in great measure dependent upon the extent of
diplomatic skill which he can employ in its favour.&nbsp; I know
not from what class of churchmen these personages are chosen, for
there is a mystery attending their origin and the circumstance of
their being stationed in these convents, which Rome does not
suffer to be penetrated.&nbsp; I have heard it said that they are
men of great note, and, perhaps, of too high ambition in the
Catholic Hierarchy, who, having fallen under the grave censure of
the Church, are banished for fixed periods to these distant
monasteries.&nbsp; I believe that the term during which they are
condemned to remain in the Holy Land is from eight to twelve
years.&nbsp; By <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>the natives of the country, as well as by the rest of
the brethren, they are looked upon as superior beings; and
rightly too, for Nature seems to have crowned them in her own
true way.</p>
<p>The chief of the Jerusalem convent was a noble creature; his
worldly and spiritual authority seemed to have surrounded him, as
it were, with a kind of &ldquo;court,&rdquo; and the manly
gracefulness of his bearing did honour to the throne which he
filled.&nbsp; There were no lords of the bedchamber, and no gold
sticks and stones in waiting, yet everybody who approached him
looked as though he were being &ldquo;presented&rdquo;; every
interview which he granted wore the air of an
&ldquo;audience&rdquo;; the brethren as often as they came near
bowed low and kissed his hand; and if he went out, the Catholics
of the place that hovered about the convent would crowd around
him with devout affection, and almost scramble for the blessing
which his touch could give.&nbsp; He bore his honours all
serenely, as though calmly conscious of his power to &ldquo;bind
and to loose.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neither</span> old &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; <a
name="citation123"></a><a href="#footnote123"
class="citation">[123]</a> himself, nor any of his helpers, knew
the road which I meant to take from Nazareth to the Sea of
Galilee and from thence to Jerusalem, so I was forced to add
another to my party by hiring a guide.&nbsp; The associations of
Nazareth, as well as my kind feeling towards the hospitable
monks, whose guest I had been, inclined me to set at naught the
advice which I had received against employing Christians.&nbsp; I
accordingly engaged a lithe, active young Nazarene, who was
recommended to me by the monks, and who affected to be familiar
with the line of country through which I intended to pass.&nbsp;
My disregard of the popular prejudices against Christians was not
justified in this particular instance by the result of my
choice.&nbsp; This you will see by and by.</p>
<p>I passed by Cana and the house in which the water had been
turned into wine; I came to the field in which our Saviour had
rebuked the Scotch Sabbath-keepers of that period, by suffering
His disciples to pluck corn on the Lord&rsquo;s Day; I rode over
the ground on which the fainting multitude had been fed, and they
showed me some massive <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>fragments&mdash;the relics, they
said, of that wondrous banquet, now turned into stone.&nbsp; The
petrifaction was most complete.</p>
<p>I ascended the height on which our Lord was standing when He
wrought the miracle.&nbsp; The hill was lofty enough to show me
the fairness of the land on all sides, but I have an ancient love
for the mere features of a lake, and so forgetting all else when
I reached the summit, I looked away eagerly to the
eastward.&nbsp; There she lay, the Sea of Galilee.&nbsp; Less
stern than Wast Water, less fair than gentle Windermere, she had
still the winning ways of an English lake; she caught from the
smiling heavens unceasing light and changeful phases of beauty,
and with all this brightness on her face, she yet clung so fondly
to the dull he-looking mountain at her side, as though she
would</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If one might judge of men&rsquo;s real thoughts by their
writings, it would seem that there are people who can visit an
interesting locality and follow up continuously the exact train
of thought that ought to be suggested by the historical
associations of the place.&nbsp; A person of this sort can go to
Athens and think of nothing later than the age of Pericles; can
live with the Scipios as long as he stays in Rome; can go up in a
balloon, and think how resplendently in former times the now
vacant and desolate air was peopled with angels, how prettily it
was crossed at intervals by the rounds of Jacob&rsquo;s
ladder!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t possess this power at all; it is only
by snatches, and for few <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>moments together, that I can really
associate a place with its proper history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There at Tiberias, and along this western shore towards
the north, and upon the bosom too of the lake, our Saviour and
His disciples&rdquo;&mdash;away flew those recollections, and my
mind strained eastward, because that that farthest shore was the
end of the world that belongs to man the dweller, the beginning
of the other and veiled world that is held by the strange race,
whose life (like the pastime of Satan) is a &ldquo;going to and
fro upon the face of the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; From those grey
hills right away to the gates of Bagdad stretched forth the
mysterious &ldquo;desert&rdquo;&mdash;not a pale, void, sandy
tract, but a land abounding in rich pastures, a land without
cities or towns, without any &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; people or
any &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; things, yet yielding its eighty
thousand cavalry to the beck of a few old men.&nbsp; But once
more&mdash;&ldquo;Tiberias&mdash;the plain of
Gennesareth&mdash;the very earth on which I stood&mdash;that the
deep low tones of the Saviour&rsquo;s voice should have gone
forth into eternity from out of the midst of these hills and
these valleys!&rdquo;&mdash;Ay, ay, but yet again the calm face
of the lake was uplifted, and smiled upon my eyes with such
familiar gaze, that the &ldquo;deep low tones&rdquo; were hushed,
the listening multitudes all passed away, and instead there came
to me a dear old memory from over the seas in England, a memory
sweeter than Gospel to that poor wilful mortal, me.</p>
<p>I went to Tiberias, and soon got afloat upon the water.&nbsp;
In the evening I took up my quarters in the Catholic church, and
the building being large enough, the whole of my party were
admitted to the benefit of the same shelter.&nbsp; With
portmanteaus and carpet bags, and books and maps, and fragrant
tea, Mysseri <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>soon made me a home on the southern side of the
church.&nbsp; One of old Shereef&rsquo;s helpers was an
enthusiastic Catholic, and was greatly delighted at having so
sacred a lodging.&nbsp; He lit up the altar with a number of
tapers, and when his preparations were complete, he began to
perform his orisons in the strangest manner imaginable.&nbsp; His
lips muttered the prayers of the Latin Church, but he bowed
himself down and laid his forehead to the stones beneath him
after the manner of a Mussulman.&nbsp; The universal aptness of a
religious system for all stages of civilisation, and for all
sorts and conditions of men, well befits its claim of divine
origin.&nbsp; She is of all nations, and of all times, that
wonderful Church of Rome!</p>
<p>Tiberias is one of the four holy cities, <a
name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126"
class="citation">[126]</a> according to the Talmud, and it is
from this place, or the immediate neighbourhood of it, that the
Messiah is to arise.</p>
<p>Except at Jerusalem, never think of attempting to sleep in a
&ldquo;holy city.&rdquo;&nbsp; Old Jews from all parts of the
world go to lay their bones upon the sacred soil, and as these
people never return to their homes, it follows that any domestic
vermin which they may bring with them are likely to become
permanently resident, so that the population is continually
increasing.&nbsp; No recent census had been taken when I was at
Tiberias, but I know that the congregation of fleas which
attended at my church alone must have been something
enormous.&nbsp; It was a carnal, self-seeking congregation,
wholly inattentive to the service which was going on, and devoted
to the one object of having my blood.&nbsp; The fleas of all
nations were there.&nbsp; The smug, steady, importunate flea from
<a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>Holywell
Street; the pert, jumping <i>puce</i> from hungry France, the
wary, watchful <i>pulce</i> with his poisoned stiletto; the
vengeful <i>pulga</i> of Castile with his ugly knife; the German
<i>floh</i> with his knife and fork, insatiate, not rising from
table; whole swarms from all the Russias, and Asiatic hordes
unnumbered&mdash;all these were there, and all rejoiced in one
great international feast.&nbsp; I could no more defend myself
against my enemies than if I had been <i>pain &agrave;
discretion</i> in the hands of a French patriot, or English gold
in the claws of a Pennsylvanian Quaker.&nbsp; After passing a
night like this you are glad to pick up the wretched remains of
your body long, long before morning dawns.&nbsp; Your skin is
scorched, your temples throb, your lips feel withered and dried,
your burning eyeballs are screwed inwards against the
brain.&nbsp; You have no hope but only in the saddle and the
freshness of the morning air.</p>

128</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MY FIRST BIVOUAC</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> course of the Jordan is from
the north to the south, and in that direction, with very little
of devious winding, it carries the shining waters of Galilee
straight down into the solitudes of the Dead Sea.&nbsp; Speaking
roughly, the river in that meridian is a boundary between the
people living under roofs and the tented tribes that wander on
the farther side.&nbsp; And so, as I went down in my way from
Tiberias towards Jerusalem, along the western bank of the stream,
my thinking all propended to the ancient world of herdsmen and
warriors that lay so close over my bridle arm.</p>
<p>If a man, and an Englishman, be not born of his mother with a
natural Chiffney-bit in his mouth, there comes to him a time for
loathing the wearisome ways of society; a time for not liking
tamed people; a time for not dancing quadrilles, not sitting in
pews; a time for pretending that Milton and Shelley, and all
sorts of mere dead people, were greater in death than the first
living Lord of the Treasury; a time, in short, for scoffing and
railing, for speaking lightly of the very opera, and all our most
cherished institutions.&nbsp; It is from nineteen to two or three
and twenty perhaps that this war of the man against men <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>is like to
be waged most sullenly.&nbsp; You are yet in this smiling
England, but you find yourself wending away to the dark sides of
her mountains, climbing the dizzy crags, exulting in the
fellowship of mists and clouds, and watching the storms how they
gather, or proving the mettle of your mare upon the broad and
dreary downs, because that you feel congenially with the yet
unparcelled earth.&nbsp; A little while you are free and
unlabelled, like the ground that you compass; but civilisation is
coming and coming; you and your much-loved waste lands will be
surely enclosed, and sooner or later brought down to a state of
mere usefulness; the ground will be curiously sliced into acres
and roods and perches, and you, for all you sit so smartly in
your saddle, you will be caught, you will be taken up from travel
as a colt from grass, to be trained and tried, and matched and
run.&nbsp; All this in time, but first come Continental tours and
the moody longing for Eastern travel.&nbsp; The downs and the
moors of England can hold you no longer; with large strides you
burst away from these slips and patches of free land; you thread
your path through the crowds of Europe, and at last, on the banks
of Jordan, you joyfully know that you are upon the very frontier
of all accustomed respectabilities.&nbsp; There, on the other
side of the river (you can swim it with one arm), there reigns
the people that will be like to put you to death for <i>not</i>
being a vagrant, for <i>not</i> being a robber, for <i>not</i>
being armed and houseless.&nbsp; There is comfort in
that&mdash;health, comfort, and strength to one who is dying from
very weariness of that poor, dear, middle-aged, deserving,
accomplished, pedantic, and painstaking governess, Europe.</p>
<p>I had ridden for some hours along the right bank of Jordan
when I came to the Djesr el Medjam&eacute; (an <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>old Roman
bridge, I believe), which crossed the river.&nbsp; My Nazarene
guide was riding ahead of the party, and now, to my surprise and
delight, he turned leftwards, and led on over the bridge.&nbsp; I
knew that the true road to Jerusalem must be mainly by the right
bank of Jordan, but I supposed that my guide was crossing the
bridge at this spot in order to avoid some bend in the river, and
that he knew of a ford lower down by which we should regain the
western bank.&nbsp; I made no question about the road, for I was
but too glad to set my horse&rsquo;s hoofs upon the land of the
wandering tribes.&nbsp; None of my party except the Nazarene knew
the country.&nbsp; On we went through rich pastures upon the
eastern side of the water.&nbsp; I looked for the expected bend
of the river, but far as I could see it kept a straight southerly
course; I still left my guide unquestioned.</p>
<p>The Jordan is not a perfectly accurate boundary betwixt roofs
and tents, for soon after passing the bridge I came upon a
cluster of huts.&nbsp; Some time afterwards the guide, upon being
closely questioned by my servants, confessed that the village
which we had left behind was the last that we should see, but he
declared that he knew a spot at which we should find an
encampment of friendly Bedouins, who would receive me with all
hospitality.&nbsp; I had long determined not to leave the East
without seeing something of the wandering tribes, but I had
looked forward to this as a pleasure to be found in the desert
between El Arish and Egypt; I had no idea that the Bedouins on
the east of Jordan were accessible.&nbsp; My delight was so great
at the near prospect of bread and salt in the tent of an Arab
warrior, that I wilfully allowed my guide to go on and mislead
me.&nbsp; I saw that he was taking me out of the straight route
<a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>towards
Jerusalem, and was drawing me into the midst of the Bedouins; but
the idea of his betraying me seemed (I know not why) so utterly
absurd, that I could not entertain it for a moment.&nbsp; I
fancied it possible that the fellow had taken me out of my route
in order to attempt some little mercantile enterprise with the
tribe for which he was seeking, and I was glad of the opportunity
which I might thus gain of coming in contact with the
wanderers.</p>
<p>Not long after passing the village a horseman met us.&nbsp; It
appeared that some of the cavalry of Ibrahim Pasha had crossed
the river for the sake of the rich pastures on the eastern bank,
and that this man was one of the troopers.&nbsp; He stopped and
saluted; he was obviously surprised at meeting an unarmed, or
half-armed, cavalcade, and at last fairly told us that we were on
the wrong side of the river, and that if we proceeded we must lay
our account with falling amongst robbers.&nbsp; All this while,
and throughout the day, my Nazarene kept well ahead of the party,
and was constantly up in his stirrups, straining forward and
searching the distance for some objects which still remained
unseen.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day we saw no human being; we pushed on
eagerly in the hope of coming up with the Bedouins before
nightfall.&nbsp; Night came, and we still went on in our way till
about ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Then the thorough darkness of the
night, and the weariness of our beasts (which had already done
two good days&rsquo; journey in one), forced us to determine upon
coming to a standstill.&nbsp; Upon the heights to the eastward we
saw lights; these shone from caves on the mountain-side,
inhabited, as the Nazarene told us, by rascals of a low
sort&mdash;not real Bedouins, men whom we might frighten into
harmlessness, but <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>from whom there was no willing hospitality to be
expected.</p>
<p>We heard at a little distance the brawling of a rivulet, and
on the banks of this it was determined to establish our
bivouac.&nbsp; We soon found the stream, and following its course
for a few yards, came to a spot which was thought to be fit for
our purpose.&nbsp; It was a sharply cold night in February, and
when I dismounted I found myself standing upon some wet rank
herbage that promised ill for the comfort of our
resting-place.&nbsp; I had bad hopes of a fire, for the pitchy
darkness of the night was a great obstacle to any successful
search for fuel, and, besides, the boughs of trees or bushes
would be so full of sap in this early spring, that they would not
be easily persuaded to burn.&nbsp; However, we were not likely to
submit to a dark and cold bivouac without an effort, and my
fellows groped forward through the darkness, till after advancing
a few paces they were happily stopped by a complete barrier of
dead prickly bushes.&nbsp; Before our swords could be drawn to
reap this welcome harvest it was found to our surprise that the
fuel was already hewn and strewed along the ground in a thick
mass.&nbsp; A spot for the fire was found with some difficulty,
for the earth was moist and the grass high and rank.&nbsp; At
last there was a clicking of flint and steel, and presently there
stood out from darkness one of the tawny faces of my muleteers,
bent down to near the ground, and suddenly lit up by the glowing
of the spark which he courted with careful breath.&nbsp; Before
long there was a particle of dry fibre or leaf that kindled to a
tiny flame; then another was lit from that, and then
another.&nbsp; Then small crisp twigs, little bigger than
bodkins, were laid athwart the glowing fire.&nbsp; The swelling
cheeks of the muleteer, <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>laid level with the earth, blew
tenderly at first and then more boldly upon the young flame,
which was daintily nursed and fed, and fed more plentifully when
it gained good strength.&nbsp; At last a whole armful of dry
bushes was piled up over the fire, and presently, with a loud
cheery crackling and crackling, a royal tall blaze shot up from
the earth and showed me once more the shapes and faces of my men,
and the dim outlines of the horses and mules that stood grazing
hard by.</p>
<p>My servants busied themselves in unpacking the baggage as
though we had arrived at an hotel&mdash;Shereef and his helpers
unsaddled their cattle.&nbsp; We had left Tiberias without the
slightest idea that we were to make our way to Jerusalem along
the desolate side of the Jordan, and my servants (generally
provident in those matters) had brought with them only, I think,
some unleavened bread and a rocky fragment of goat&rsquo;s-milk
cheese.&nbsp; These treasures were produced.&nbsp; Tea and the
contrivances for making it were always a standing part of my
baggage.&nbsp; My men gathered in circle round the fire.&nbsp;
The Nazarene was in a false position from having misled us so
strangely, and he would have shrunk back, poor devil, into the
cold and outer darkness, but I made him draw near and share the
luxuries of the night.&nbsp; My quilt and my pelisse were spread,
and the rest of my party had all their capotes or pelisses, or
robes of some sort, which furnished their couches.&nbsp; The men
gathered in circle, some kneeling, some sitting, some lying
reclined around our common hearth.&nbsp; Sometimes on one,
sometimes on another, the flickering light would glare more
fiercely.&nbsp; Sometimes it was the good Shereef that seemed the
foremost, as he sat with venerable beard the <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>image of
manly piety&mdash;unknowing of all geography, unknowing where he
was or whither he might go, but trusting in the goodness of God
and the clinching power of fate and the good star of the
Englishman.&nbsp; Sometimes, like marble, the classic face of the
Greek Mysseri would catch the sudden light, and then again by
turns the ever-perturbed Dthemetri, with his old Chinaman&rsquo;s
eye and bristling, terrier-like moustache, shone forth
illustrious.</p>
<p>I always liked the men who attended me on these Eastern
travels, for they were all of them brave, cheery-hearted fellows;
and although their following my career brought upon them a pretty
large share of those toils and hardships which are so much more
amusing to gentlemen than to servants, yet not one of them ever
uttered or hinted a syllable of complaint, or even affected to
put on an air of resignation.&nbsp; I always liked them, but
never perhaps so much as when they were thus grouped together
under the light of the bivouac fire.&nbsp; I felt towards them as
my comrades rather than as my servants, and took delight in
breaking bread with them, and merrily passing the cup.</p>
<p>The love of tea is a glad source of fellow-feeling between the
Englishman and the Asiatic.&nbsp; In Persia it is drunk by all,
and although it is a luxury that is rarely within the reach of
the Osmanlees, there are few of them who do not know and love the
blessed <i>tch&auml;i</i>.&nbsp; Our camp-kettle, filled from the
brook, hummed doubtfully for a while, then busily bubbled under
the sidelong glare of the flames; cups clinked and rattled; the
fragrant steam ascended, and soon this little circlet in the
wilderness grew warm and genial as my lady&rsquo;s
drawing-room.</p>
<p>And after this there came the <i>tchibouque</i>&mdash;great
comforter of those that are hungry and wayworn.&nbsp; <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>And it has
this virtue&mdash;it helps to destroy the <i>g&ecirc;ne</i> and
awkwardness which one sometimes feels at being in company with
one&rsquo;s dependants; for whilst the amber is at your lips,
there is nothing ungracious in your remaining silent, or speaking
pithily in short inter-whiff sentences.&nbsp; And for us that
night there was pleasant and plentiful matter of talk; for the
where we should be on the morrow, and the wherewithal we should
be fed, whether by some ford we should regain the western bank of
Jordan, or find bread and salt under the tents of a wandering
tribe, or whether we should fall into the hands of the
Philistines, and so come to see death&mdash;the last and greatest
of all &ldquo;the fine sights&rdquo; that there be&mdash;these
were questionings not dull nor wearisome to us, for we were all
concerned in the answers.&nbsp; And it was not an all-imagined
morrow that we probed with our sharp guesses, for the lights of
those low Philistines, the men of the caves, still hung over our
heads, and we knew by their yells that the fire of our bivouac
had shown us.</p>
<p>At length we thought it well to seek for sleep.&nbsp; Our
plans were laid for keeping up a good watch through the
night.&nbsp; My quilt and my pelisse and my cloak were spread out
so that I might lie spokewise, with my feet towards the central
fire.&nbsp; I wrapped my limbs daintily round, and gave myself
positive orders to sleep like a veteran soldier.&nbsp; But I
found that my attempt to sleep upon the earth that God gave me
was more new and strange than I had fancied it.&nbsp; I had grown
used to the scene which was before me whilst I was sitting or
reclining by the side of the fire, but now that I laid myself
down at length it was the deep black mystery of the heavens that
hung over my eyes&mdash;not an earthly thing in the way from <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>my own very
forehead right up to the end of all space.&nbsp; I grew proud of
my boundless bedchamber.&nbsp; I might have &ldquo;found
sermons&rdquo; in all this greatness (if I had I should surely
have slept), but such was not then my way.&nbsp; If this
cherished self of mine had built the universe, I should have
dwelt with delight on &ldquo;the wonders of
creation.&rdquo;&nbsp; As it was, I felt rather the vain-glory of
my promotion from out of mere rooms and houses into the midst of
that grand, dark, infinite palace.</p>
<p>And then, too, my head, far from the fire, was in cold
latitudes, and it seemed to me strange that I should be lying so
still and passive, whilst the sharp night breeze walked free over
my cheek, and the cold damp clung to my hair, as though my face
grew in the earth and must bear with the footsteps of the wind
and the falling of the dew as meekly as the grass of the
field.&nbsp; Besides, I got puzzled and distracted by having to
endure heat and cold at the same time, for I was always
considering whether my feet were not over-devilled and whether my
face was not too well iced.&nbsp; And so when from time to time
the watch quietly and gently kept up the languishing fire, he
seldom, I think, was unseen to my restless eyes.&nbsp; Yet, at
last, when they called me and said that the morn would soon be
dawning, I rose from a state of half-oblivion not much unlike to
sleep, though sharply qualified by a sort of vegetable&rsquo;s
consciousness of having been growing still colder and colder for
many and many an hour.</p>
<h2><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE DEAD SEA</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> grey light of the morning
showed us for the first time the ground which we had chosen for
our resting-place.&nbsp; We found that we had bivouacked upon a
little patch of barley plainly belonging to the men of the
caves.&nbsp; The dead bushes which we found so happily placed in
readiness for our fire had been strewn as a fence for the
protection of the little crop.&nbsp; This was the only cultivated
spot of ground which we had seen for many a league, and I was
rather sorry to find that our night fire and our cattle had
spread so much ruin upon this poor solitary slip of
corn-land.</p>
<p>The saddling and loading of our beasts was a work which
generally took nearly an hour, and before this was half over
daylight came.&nbsp; We could now see the men of the caves.&nbsp;
They collected in a body, amounting, I should think, to nearly
fifty, and rushed down towards our quarters with fierce shouts
and yells.&nbsp; But the nearer they got the slower they went;
their shouts grew less resolute in tone, and soon ceased
altogether.&nbsp; The fellows, however, advanced to a thicket
within thirty yards of us, and behind this &ldquo;took up their
position.&rdquo;&nbsp; My men without premeditation did exactly
that which was <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>best; they kept steadily to their work of loading the
beasts without fuss or hurry; and whether it was that they
instinctively felt the wisdom of keeping quiet, or that they
merely obeyed the natural inclination to silence which one feels
in the early morning, I cannot tell, but I know that, except when
they exchanged a syllable or two relative to the work they were
about, not a word was said.&nbsp; I now believe that this
quietness of our party created an undefined terror in the minds
of the cave-holders and scared them from coming on; it gave them
a notion that we were relying on some resources which they knew
not of.&nbsp; Several times the fellows tried to lash themselves
into a state of excitement which might do instead of pluck.&nbsp;
They would raise a great shout and sway forward in a dense body
from behind the thicket; but when they saw that their bravery
thus gathered to a head did not even suspend the strapping of a
portmanteau or the tying of a hatbox, their shout lost its
spirit, and the whole mass was irresistibly drawn back like a
wave receding from the shore.</p>
<p>These attempts at an onset were repeated several times, but
always with the same result.&nbsp; I remained under the
apprehension of an attack for more than half an hour, and it
seemed to me that the work of packing and loading had never been
done so slowly.&nbsp; I felt inclined to tell my fellows to make
their best speed, but just as I was going to speak I observed
that every one was doing his duty already; I therefore held my
peace and said not a word, till at last Mysseri led up my horse
and asked me if I were ready to mount.</p>
<p>We all marched off without hindrance.</p>
<p>After some time we came across a party of Ibrahim&rsquo;s
cavalry, which had bivouacked at no great distance from us.&nbsp;
The knowledge that such a force <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>was in the neighbourhood may have
conduced to the forbearance of the cave-holders.</p>
<p>We saw a scraggy-looking fellow nearly black, and wearing
nothing but a cloth round the loins; he was tending flocks.&nbsp;
Afterwards I came up with another of these goatherds, whose
helpmate was with him.&nbsp; They gave us some goat&rsquo;s milk,
a welcome present.&nbsp; I pitied the poor devil of a goat-herd
for having such a very plain wife.&nbsp; I spend an enormous
quantity of pity upon that particular form of human misery.</p>
<p>About midday I began to examine my map and to question my
guide, who at last fell on his knees and confessed that he knew
nothing of the country in which we were.&nbsp; I was thus thrown
upon my own resources, and calculating that on the preceding day
we had nearly performed a two days&rsquo; journey, I concluded
that the Dead Sea must be near.&nbsp; In this I was right, for at
about three or four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon I caught a
first sight of its dismal face.</p>
<p>I went on and came near to those waters of death.&nbsp; They
stretched deeply into the southern desert, and before me, and all
around, as far away as the eye could follow, blank hills piled
high over hills, pale, yellow, and naked, walled up in her tomb
for ever the dead and damned Gomorrah.&nbsp; There was no fly
that hummed in the forbidden air, but instead a deep stillness;
no grass grew from the earth, no weed peered through the void
sand; but in mockery of all life there were trees borne down by
Jordan in some ancient flood, and these, grotesquely planted upon
the forlorn shore, spread out their grim skeleton arms, all
scorched and charred to blackness by the heats of the long silent
years.</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>I now
struck off towards the d&eacute;bouchure of the river; but I
found that the country, though seemingly quite flat, was
intersected by deep ravines, which did not show themselves until
nearly approached.&nbsp; For some time my progress was much
obstructed; but at last I came across a track which led towards
the river, and which might, as I hoped, bring me to a ford.&nbsp;
I found, in fact, when I came to the river&rsquo;s side that the
track reappeared upon the opposite bank, plainly showing that the
stream had been fordable at this place.&nbsp; Now, however, in
consequence of the late rains the river was quite impracticable
for baggage-horses.&nbsp; A body of waters about equal to the
Thames at Eton, but confined to a narrower channel, poured down
in a current so swift and heavy, that the idea of passing with
laden baggage-horses was utterly forbidden.&nbsp; I could have
swum across myself, and I might, perhaps, have succeeded in
swimming a horse over; but this would have been useless, because
in such case I must have abandoned not only my baggage, but all
my attendants, for none of them were able to swim, and without
that resource it would have been madness for them to rely upon
the swimming of their beasts across such a powerful stream.&nbsp;
I still hoped, however, that there might be a chance of passing
the river at the point of its actual junction with the Dead Sea,
and I therefore went on in that direction.</p>
<p>Night came upon us whilst labouring across gullies and sandy
mounds, and we were obliged to come to a standstill quite
suddenly upon the very edge of a precipitous descent.&nbsp; Every
step towards the Dead Sea had brought us into a country more and
more dreary; and this sandhill, which we were forced to choose
for our resting-place, was dismal <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>enough.&nbsp; A few slender blades
of grass, which here and there singly pierced the sand, mocked
bitterly the hunger of our jaded beasts, and with our small
remaining fragment of goat&rsquo;s-milk rock by way of supper, we
were not much better off than our horses.&nbsp; We wanted, too,
the great requisite of a cheery bivouac-fire.&nbsp; Moreover, the
spot on which we had been so suddenly brought to a standstill was
relatively high and unsheltered, and the night wind blew swiftly
and cold.</p>
<p>The next morning I reached the d&eacute;bouchure of the
Jordan, where I had hoped to find a bar of sand that might render
its passage possible.&nbsp; The river, however, rolled its
eddying waters fast down to the &ldquo;sea&rdquo; in a strong,
deep stream that shut out all hope of crossing.</p>
<p>It now seemed necessary either to construct a raft of some
kind, or else to retrace my steps and remount the banks of the
Jordan.&nbsp; I had once happened to give some attention to the
subject of military bridges&mdash;a branch of military science
which includes the construction of rafts and contrivances of the
like sort&mdash;and I should have been very proud indeed if I
could have carried my party and my baggage across by dint of any
idea gathered from Sir Howard Douglas or Robinson Crusoe.&nbsp;
But we were all faint and languid from want of food, and besides
there were no materials.&nbsp; Higher up the river there were
bushes and river plants, but nothing like timber; and the cord
with which my baggage was tied to the pack-saddles amounted
altogether to a very small quantity, not nearly enough to haul
any sort of craft across the stream.</p>
<p>And now it was, if I remember rightly, that Dthemetri
submitted to me a plan for putting to <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>death the Nazarene, whose
misguidance had been the cause of our difficulties.&nbsp; There
was something fascinating in this suggestion, for the slaying of
the guide was of course easy enough, and would look like an act
of what politicians call &ldquo;vigour.&rdquo;&nbsp; If it were
only to become known to my friends in England that I had calmly
killed a fellow-creature for taking me out of my way, I might
remain perfectly quiet and tranquil for all the rest of my days,
quite free from the danger of being considered
&ldquo;slow&rdquo;; I might ever after live on upon my
reputation, like &ldquo;single-speech Hamilton&rdquo; in the last
century, or &ldquo;single sin&mdash;&rdquo; in this, without
being obliged to take the trouble of doing any more harm in the
world.&nbsp; This was a great temptation to an indolent person,
but the motive was not strengthened by any sincere feeling of
anger with the Nazarene.&nbsp; Whilst the question of his life
and death was debated he was riding in front of our party, and
there was something in the anxious writhing of his supple limbs
that seemed to express a sense of his false position, and struck
me as highly comic.&nbsp; I had no crotchet at that time against
the punishment of death, but I was unused to blood, and the
proposed victim looked so thoroughly capable of enjoying life (if
he could only get to the other side of the river), that I thought
it would be hard for him to die merely in order to give me a
character for energy.&nbsp; Acting on the result of these
considerations, and reserving to myself a free and unfettered
discretion to have the poor villain shot at any future moment, I
magnanimously decided that for the present he should live, and
not die.</p>
<p>I bathed in the Dead Sea.&nbsp; The ground covered by the
water sloped so gradually, that I was not only forced to
&ldquo;sneak in,&rdquo; but to walk through the water <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>nearly a
quarter of a mile before I could get out of my depth.&nbsp; When
at last I was able to attempt to dive, the salts held in solution
made my eyes smart so sharply, that the pain which I thus
suffered, together with the weakness occasioned by want of food,
made me giddy and faint for some moments, but I soon grew
better.&nbsp; I knew beforehand the impossibility of sinking in
this buoyant water, but I was surprised to find that I could not
swim at my accustomed pace; my legs and feet were lifted so high
and dry out of the lake, that my stroke was baffled, and I found
myself kicking against the thin air instead of the dense fluid
upon which I was swimming.&nbsp; The water is perfectly bright
and clear; its taste detestable.&nbsp; After finishing my
attempts at swimming and diving, I took some time in regaining
the shore, and before I began to dress I found that the sun had
already evaporated the water which clung to me, and that my skin
was thickly encrusted with salts.</p>
<h2><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BLACK TENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> steps were reluctantly turned
towards the north.&nbsp; I had ridden some way, and still it
seemed that all life was fenced and barred out from the desolate
ground over which I was journeying.&nbsp; On the west there
flowed the impassable Jordan, on the east stood an endless range
of barren mountains, and on the south lay that desert sea that
knew not the plashing of an oar; greatly therefore was I
surprised when suddenly there broke upon my ear the long,
ludicrous, persevering bray of a donkey.&nbsp; I was riding at
this time some few hundred yards ahead of all my party except the
Nazarene (who by a wise instinct kept closer to me than to
Dthemetri), and I instantly went forward in the direction of the
sound, for I fancied that where there were donkeys, there too
most surely would be men.&nbsp; The ground on all sides of me
seemed thoroughly void and lifeless, but at last I got down into
a hollow, and presently a sudden turn brought me within thirty
yards of an Arab encampment.&nbsp; The low black tents which I
had so long lusted to see were right before me, and they were all
teeming with live Arabs&mdash;men, women, and children.</p>
<p>I wished to have let my party behind know <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>where I
was, but I recollected that they would be able to trace me by the
prints of my horse&rsquo;s hoofs in the sand; and having to do
with Asiatics, I felt the danger of the slightest movement which
might be looked upon as a sign of irresolution.&nbsp; Therefore,
without looking behind me, without looking to the right or to the
left, I rode straight up towards the foremost tent.&nbsp; Before
this was strewed a semi-circular fence of dead boughs, through
which there was an opening opposite to the front of the
tent.&nbsp; As I advanced, some twenty or thirty of the most
uncouth-looking fellows imaginable came forward to meet me.&nbsp;
In their appearance they showed nothing of the Bedouin blood;
they were of many colours, from dingy brown to jet black, and
some of these last had much of the negro look about them.&nbsp;
They were tall, powerful fellows, but awfully ugly.&nbsp; They
wore nothing but the Arab shirts, confined at the waist by
leathern belts.</p>
<p>I advanced to the gap left in the fence, and at once alighted
from my horse.&nbsp; The chief greeted me after his fashion by
alternately touching first my hand and then his own forehead, as
if he were conveying the virtue of the touch like a spark of
electricity.&nbsp; Presently I found myself seated upon a
sheepskin, which was spread for me under the sacred shade of
Arabian canvas.&nbsp; The tent was of a long, narrow, oblong
form, and contained a quantity of men, women, and children so
closely huddled together, that there was scarcely one of them who
was not in actual contact with his neighbour.&nbsp; The moment I
had taken my seat the chief repeated his salutations in the most
enthusiastic manner, and then the people having gathered densely
about me, got hold of my unresisting hand and passed it round
like a claret jug <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>for the benefit of everybody.&nbsp; The women soon
brought me a wooden bowl full of buttermilk, and welcome indeed
came the gift to my hungry and thirsty soul.</p>
<p>After some time my party, as I had expected, came up, and when
poor Dthemetri saw me on my sheepskin, &ldquo;the life and
soul&rdquo; of this ragamuffin party, he was so astounded, that
he even failed to check his cry of horror; he plainly thought
that now, at last, the Lord had delivered me (interpreter and
all) into the hands of the lowest Philistines.</p>
<p>Mysseri carried a tobacco-pouch slung at his belt, and as soon
as its contents were known the whole population of the tent began
begging like spaniels for bits of the beloved weed.&nbsp; I
concluded from the abject manner of these people that they could
not possibly be thoroughbred Bedouins, and I saw, too, that they
must be in the very last stage of misery, for poor indeed is the
man in these climes who cannot command a pipeful of
tobacco.&nbsp; I began to think that I had fallen amongst
thorough savages, and it seemed likely enough that they would
gain their very first knowledge of civilisation by ravishing and
studying the contents of my dearest portmanteaus, but still my
impression was that they would hardly venture upon such an
attempt.&nbsp; I observed, indeed, that they did not offer me the
bread and salt which I had understood to be the pledges of peace
amongst wandering tribes, but I fancied that they refrained from
this act of hospitality, not in consequence of any hostile
determination, but in order that the notion of robbing me might
remain for the present an &ldquo;open question.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
afterwards found that the poor fellows had no bread to
offer.&nbsp; They were literally &ldquo;out at
grass.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is true that they had a scanty supply of
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>milk
from goats, but they were living almost entirely upon certain
grass stems, which were just in season at that time of the
year.&nbsp; These, if not highly nourishing, are pleasant enough
to the taste, and their acid juices come gratefully to thirsty
lips.</p>
<h2><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PASSAGE OF THE JORDAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now Dthemetri began to enter
into a negotiation with my hosts for a passage over the
river.&nbsp; I never interfered with my worthy dragoman upon
these occasions, because from my entire ignorance of the Arabic I
should have been quite unable to exercise any real control over
his words, and it would have been silly to break the stream of
his eloquence to no purpose.&nbsp; I have reason to fear,
however, that he lied transcendently, and especially in
representing me as the bosom friend of Ibrahim Pasha.&nbsp; The
mention of that name produced immense agitation and excitement,
and the Sheik explained to Dthemetri the grounds of the infinite
respect which he and his tribe entertained for the Pasha.&nbsp; A
few weeks before Ibrahim had craftily sent a body of troops
across the Jordan.&nbsp; The force went warily round to the foot
of the mountains on the east, so as to cut off the retreat of
this tribe, and then surrounded them as they lay encamped in the
vale; their camels, and indeed all their possessions worth
taking, were carried off by the soldiery, and moreover the then
Sheik, together with every tenth man of the tribe, was brought
out and shot.&nbsp; You would think that this conduct on <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>the part of
the Pasha might not procure for his &ldquo;friend&rdquo; a very
gracious reception amongst the people whom he had thus despoiled
and decimated; but the Asiatic seems to be animated with a
feeling of profound respect, almost bordering upon affection, for
all who have done him any bold and violent wrong; and there is
always, too, so much of vague and undefined apprehension mixed up
with his really well-founded alarms, that I can see no limit to
the yielding and bending of his mind when it is wrought upon by
the idea of power.</p>
<p>After some discussion the Arabs agreed, as I thought, to
conduct me to a ford, and we moved on towards the river, followed
by seventeen of the most able-bodied of the tribe, under the
guidance of several grey-bearded elders, and Sheik Ali Djoubran
at the head of the whole detachment.&nbsp; Upon leaving the
encampment a sort of ceremony was performed, for the purpose, it
seemed, of ensuring, if possible, a happy result for the
undertaking.&nbsp; There was an uplifting of arms, and a
repeating of words that sounded like formul&aelig;, but there
were no prostrations, and I did not understand that the ceremony
was of a religious character.&nbsp; The tented Arabs are looked
upon as very bad Mahometans. <a name="citation149"></a><a
href="#footnote149" class="citation">[149]</a></p>
<p>We arrived upon the banks of the river&mdash;not at a ford,
but at a deep and rapid part of the stream, and I now understood
that it was the plan of these men, <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>if they helped me at all, to
transport me across the river by some species of raft.&nbsp; But
a reaction had taken place in the opinions of many, and a violent
dispute arose upon a motion which seemed to have been made by
some honourable member with a view to robbery.&nbsp; The fellows
all gathered together in circle, at a little distance from my
party, and there disputed with great vehemence and fury for
nearly two hours.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t give a correct report of
the debate, for it was held in a barbarous dialect of the Arabic
unknown to my dragoman.&nbsp; I recollect I sincerely felt at the
time that the arguments in favour of robbing me must have been
almost unanswerable, and I gave great credit to the speakers on
my side for the ingenuity and sophistry which they must have
shown in maintaining the fight so well.</p>
<p>During the discussion I remained lying in front of my baggage,
which had all been taken from the pack-saddles and placed upon
the ground.&nbsp; I was so languid from want of food, that I had
scarcely animation enough to feel as deeply interested as you
would suppose in the result of the discussion.&nbsp; I thought,
however, that the pleasantest toys to play with during this
interval were my pistols, and now and then, when I listlessly
visited my loaded barrels with the swivel ramrods, or drew a
sweet, musical click from my English firelocks, it seemed to me
that I exercised a slight and gentle influence on the
debate.&nbsp; Thanks to Ibrahim Pasha&rsquo;s terrible visitation
the men of the tribe were wholly unarmed, and my <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>advantage
in this respect might have counterbalanced in some measure the
superiority of numbers.</p>
<p>Mysseri (not interpreting in Arabic) had no duty to perform,
and he seemed to be faint and listless as myself.&nbsp; Shereef
looked perfectly resigned to any fate.&nbsp; But Dthemetri
(faithful terrier!) was bristling with zeal and
watchfulness.&nbsp; He could not understand the debate, which
indeed was carried on at a distance too great to be easily heard,
even if the language had been familiar; but he was always on the
alert, and now and then conferring with men who had straggled out
of the assembly.&nbsp; At last he found an opportunity of making
a proposal, which at once produced immense sensation; he offered,
on my behalf, that if the tribe should bear themselves loyally
towards me, and take my party and my baggage in safety to the
other bank of the river, I should give them a <i>teskeri</i>, or
written certificate of their good conduct, which might avail them
hereafter in the hour of their direst need.&nbsp; This proposal
was received and instantly accepted by all the men of the tribe
there present with the utmost enthusiasm.&nbsp; I was to give the
men, too, a <i>baksheish</i>, that is, a present of money, which
is usually made upon the conclusion of any sort of treaty; but
although the people of the tribe were so miserably poor, they
seemed to look upon the pecuniary part of the arrangement as a
matter quite trivial in comparison with the <i>teskeri</i>.&nbsp;
Indeed the sum which Dthemetri promised them was extremely small,
and not the slightest attempt was made to extort any further
reward.</p>
<p>The council now broke up, and most of the men rushed madly
towards me, and overwhelmed me with vehement gratulations; they
caressed my boots <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>with much affection, and my hands were severely
kissed.</p>
<p>The Arabs now went to work in right earnest to effect the
passage of the river.&nbsp; They had brought with them a great
number of the skins which they use for carrying water in the
desert; these they filled with air, and fastened several of them
to small boughs which they cut from the banks of the river.&nbsp;
In this way they constructed a raft not more than about four or
five feet square, but rendered buoyant by the inflated skins
which supported it.&nbsp; On this a portion of my baggage was
placed, and was firmly tied to it by the cords used on my
pack-saddles.&nbsp; The little raft with its weighty cargo was
then gently lifted into the water, and I had the satisfaction to
see that it floated well.</p>
<p>Twelve of the Arabs now stripped, and tied inflated skins to
their loins; six of the men went down into the river, got in
front of the little raft, and pulled it off a few feet from the
bank.&nbsp; The other six then dashed into the stream with loud
shouts, and swam along after the raft, pushing it from
behind.&nbsp; Off went the craft in capital style at first, for
the stream was easy on the eastern side; but I saw that the tug
was to come, for the main torrent swept round in a bend near the
western bank of the river.</p>
<p>The old men, with their long grey grisly beards, stood
shouting and cheering, praying and commanding.&nbsp; At length
the raft entered upon the difficult part of its course; the
whirling stream seized and twisted it about, and then bore it
rapidly downwards; the swimmers flagged, and seemed to be beaten
in the struggle.&nbsp; But now the old men on the bank, with
their rigid arms uplifted straight, sent forth a <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>cry and a
shout that tore the wide air into tatters, and then to make their
urging yet more strong they shrieked out the dreadful syllables,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Brahim Pasha!&rdquo;&nbsp; The swimmers, one moment
before so blown and so weary, found lungs to answer the cry, and
shouting back the name of their great destroyer, they dashed on
through the torrent, and bore the raft in safety to the western
bank.</p>
<p>Afterwards the swimmers returned with the raft, and attached
to it the rest of my baggage.&nbsp; I took my seat upon the top
of the cargo, and the raft thus laden passed the river in the
same way, and with the same struggle as before.&nbsp; The skins,
however, not being perfectly air-tight, had lost a great part of
their buoyancy, so that I, as well as the luggage that passed on
this last voyage, got wet in the waters of Jordan.&nbsp; The raft
could not be trusted for another trip, and the rest of my party
passed the river in a different and (for them) much safer
way.&nbsp; Inflated skins were fastened to their loins, and thus
supported, they were tugged across by Arabs swimming on either
side of them.&nbsp; The horses and mules were thrown into the
water and forced to swim over.&nbsp; The poor beasts had a hard
struggle for their lives in that swift stream; and I thought that
one of the horses would have been drowned, for he was too weak to
gain a footing on the western bank, and the stream bore him
down.&nbsp; At last, however, he swam back to the side from which
he had come.&nbsp; Before dark all had passed the river except
this one horse and old Shereef.&nbsp; He, poor fellow, was
shivering on the eastern bank, for his dread of the passage was
so great, that he delayed it as long as he could, and at last it
became so dark that he was obliged to wait till the morning.</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>I lay
that night on the banks of the river, and at a little distance
from me the Arabs kindled a fire, round which they sat in a
circle.&nbsp; They were made most savagely happy by the tobacco
with which I supplied them, and they soon determined that the
whole night should be one smoking festival.&nbsp; The poor
fellows had only a cracked bowl, without any tube at all, but
this morsel of a pipe they handed round from one to the other,
allowing to each a fixed number of whiffs.&nbsp; In that way they
passed the whole night.</p>
<p>The next morning old Shereef was brought across.&nbsp; It was
a strange sight to see this solemn old Mussulman, with his shaven
head and his sacred beard, sprawling and puffing upon the surface
of the water.&nbsp; When at last he reached the bank the people
told him that by his baptism in Jordan he had surely become a
mere Christian.&nbsp; Poor Shereef!&mdash;the holy man! the
descendant of the Prophet!&mdash;he was sadly hurt by the taunt,
and the more so as he seemed to feel that there was some
foundation for it, and that he really might have absorbed some
Christian errors.</p>
<p>When all was ready for departure I wrote the <i>teskeri</i> in
French and delivered it to Sheik Ali Djoubran, together with the
promised <i>baksheish</i>; he was exceedingly grateful, and I
parted in a very friendly way from this ragged tribe.</p>
<p>In two or three hours I gained Rihah, a village said to occupy
the site of ancient Jericho.&nbsp; There was one building there
which I observed with some emotion, for although it may not have
been actually standing in the days of Jericho, it contained at
this day a most interesting collection of&mdash;modern
loaves.</p>
<p>Some hours after sunset I reached the convent of Santo Saba,
and there remained for the night.</p>
<h2><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TERRA SANTA</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> enthusiasm that had glowed, or
seemed to glow, within me for one blessed moment when I knelt by
the shrine of the Virgin at Nazareth, was not rekindled at
Jerusalem.&nbsp; In the stead of the solemn gloom and the deep
stillness that of right belonged to the Holy City, there was the
hum and the bustle of active life.&nbsp; It was the &ldquo;height
of the season.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Easter ceremonies drew
near.&nbsp; The pilgrims were flocking in from all quarters; and
although their objects were partly at least of a religious
character, yet their &ldquo;arrivals&rdquo; brought as much stir
and liveliness to the city as if they had come up to marry their
daughters.</p>
<p>The votaries who every year crowd to the Holy Sepulchre are
chiefly of the Greek and Armenian Churches.&nbsp; They are not
drawn into Palestine by a mere sentimental longing to stand upon
the ground trodden by our Saviour, but rather they perform the
pilgrimage as a plain duty strongly inculcated by their
religion.&nbsp; A very great proportion of those who belong to
the Greek Church contrive at some time or other in the course of
their lives to achieve the enterprise.&nbsp; Many in their
infancy and childhood are brought to the holy sites by their
parents, but those <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>who have not had this advantage will often make it the
main object of their lives to save money enough for this holy
undertaking.</p>
<p>The pilgrims begin to arrive in Palestine some weeks before
the Easter festival of the Greek Church.&nbsp; They come from
Egypt, from all parts of Syria, from Armenia and Asia Minor, from
Stamboul, from Roumelia, from the provinces of the Danube, and
from all the Russias.&nbsp; Most of these people bring with them
some articles of merchandise, but I myself believe
(notwithstanding the common taunt against pilgrims) that they do
this rather as a mode of paying the expenses of their journey,
than from a spirit of mercenary speculation.&nbsp; They generally
travel in families, for the women are of course more ardent than
their husbands in undertaking these pious enterprises, and they
take care to bring with them all their children, however young;
for the efficacy of the rites does not depend upon the age of the
votary, so that people whose careful mothers have obtained for
them the benefit of the pilgrimage in early life, are saved from
the expense and trouble of undertaking the journey at a later
age.&nbsp; The superior veneration so often excited by objects
that are distant and unknown shows not perhaps the
wrongheadedness of a man, but rather the transcendent power of
his imagination.&nbsp; However this may be, and whether it is by
mere obstinacy that they poke their way through intervening
distance, or whether they come by the winged strength of fancy,
quite certainly the pilgrims who flock to Palestine from the most
remote homes are the people most eager in the enterprise, and in
number too they bear a very high proportion to the whole
mass.</p>
<p>The great bulk of the pilgrims make their way by <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>sea to the
port of Jaffa.&nbsp; A number of families charter a vessel
amongst them, all bringing their own provisions, which are of the
simplest and cheapest kind.&nbsp; On board every vessel thus
freighted there is, I believe, a priest, who helps the people in
their religious exercises, and tries (and fails) to maintain
something like order and harmony.&nbsp; The vessels employed in
this service are usually Greek brigs or brigantines and
schooners, and the number of passengers stowed in them is almost
always horribly excessive.&nbsp; The voyages are sadly
protracted, not only by the land-seeking, storm-flying habits of
the Greek seamen, but also by their endless schemes and
speculations, which are for ever tempting them to touch at the
nearest port.&nbsp; The voyage, too, must be made in winter, in
order that Jerusalem may be reached some weeks before the Greek
Easter, and thus by the time they attain to the holy shrines the
pilgrims have really and truly undergone a very respectable
quantity of suffering.&nbsp; I once saw one of these pious
cargoes put ashore on the coast of Cyprus, where they had touched
for the purpose of visiting (not Paphos, but) some Christian
sanctuary; I never saw (no, never even in the most horridly
stuffy ballroom) such a discomfortable collection of human
beings.&nbsp; Long huddled together in a pitching and rolling
prison, fed on beans, exposed to some real danger and to terrors
without end, they had been tumbled about for many wintry weeks in
the chopping seas of the Mediterranean.&nbsp; As soon as they
landed they stood upon the beach and chanted a hymn of thanks;
the chant was morne and doleful, but really the poor people were
looking so miserable that one could not fairly expect from them
any lively outpouring of gratitude.</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>When
the pilgrims have landed at Jaffa they hire camels, horses,
mules, or donkeys, and make their way as well as they can to the
Holy City.&nbsp; The space fronting the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre soon becomes a kind of bazaar, or rather, perhaps,
reminds you of an English fair.&nbsp; On this spot the pilgrims
display their merchandise, and there too the trading residents of
the place offer their goods for sale.&nbsp; I have never, I
think, seen elsewhere in Asia so much commercial animation as
upon this square of ground by the church door; the
&ldquo;money-changers&rdquo; seemed to be almost as brisk and
lively as if they had been <i>within</i> the temple.</p>
<p>When I entered the church I found a babel of
worshippers.&nbsp; Greek, Roman, and Armenian priests were
performing their different rites in various nooks and corners,
and crowds of disciples were rushing about in all directions,
some laughing and talking, some begging, but most of them going
round in a regular and methodical way to kiss the sanctified
spots, and speak the appointed syllables, and lay down the
accustomed coin.&nbsp; If this kissing of the shrines had seemed
as though it were done at the bidding of enthusiasm, or of any
poor sentiment even feebly approaching to it, the sight would
have been less odd to English eyes; but as it was, I stared to
see grown men thus steadily and carefully embracing the sticks
and the stones, not from love or from zeal (else God forbid that
I should have stared!), but from a calm sense of duty; they
seemed to be not &ldquo;working out,&rdquo; but
<i>transacting</i> the great business of salvation.</p>
<p>Dthemetri, however, who generally came with me when I went
out, in order to do duty as interpreter, really had in him some
enthusiasm.&nbsp; He was a <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>zealous and almost fanatical member
of the Greek Church, and had long since performed the pilgrimage,
so now great indeed was the pride and delight with which he
guided me from one holy spot to another.&nbsp; Every now and
then, when he came to an unoccupied shrine, he fell down on his
knees and performed devotion; he was almost distracted by the
temptations that surrounded him; there were so many stones
absolutely requiring to be kissed, that he rushed about happily
puzzled and sweetly teased, like &ldquo;Jack among the
maidens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Protestant, familiar with the Holy Scriptures, but ignorant
of tradition and the geography of modern Jerusalem, finds himself
a good deal &ldquo;mazed&rdquo; when he first looks for the
sacred sites.&nbsp; The Holy Sepulchre is not in a field without
the walls, but in the midst, and in the best part of the town,
under the roof of the great church which I have been talking
about.&nbsp; It is a handsome tomb of oblong form, partly
subterranean and partly above ground, and closed in on all sides
except the one by which it is entered.&nbsp; You descend into the
interior by a few steps, and there find an altar with burning
tapers.&nbsp; This is the spot which is held in greater sanctity
than any other at Jerusalem.&nbsp; When you have seen enough of
it you feel perhaps weary of the busy crowd, and inclined for a
gallop; you ask your dragoman whether there will be time before
sunset to procure horses and take a ride to Mount Calvary.&nbsp;
Mount Calvary, signor?&mdash;eccolo! it is
<i>upstairs</i>&mdash;on the <i>first floor</i>.&nbsp; In effect
you ascend, if I remember rightly, just thirteen steps, and then
you are shown the now golden sockets in which the crosses of our
Lord and the two thieves were fixed.&nbsp; All this is startling,
but the truth is, that the city having <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>gathered
round the Sepulchre, which is the main point of interest, has
crept northward, and thus in great measure are occasioned the
many geographical surprises that puzzle the &ldquo;Bible
Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Church of the Holy Sepulchre comprises very compendiously
almost all the spots associated with the closing career of our
Lord.&nbsp; Just there, on your right, He stood and wept; by the
pillar, on your left, He was scourged; on the spot, just before
you, He was crowned with the crown of thorns; up there He was
crucified, and down here He was buried.&nbsp; A locality is
assigned to every, the minutest, event connected with the
recorded history of our Saviour; even the spot where the cock
crew when Peter denied his Master is ascertained, and surrounded
by the walls of an Armenian convent.&nbsp; Many Protestants are
wont to treat these traditions contemptuously, and those who
distinguish themselves from their brethren by the appellation of
&ldquo;Bible Christians&rdquo; are almost fierce in their
denunciation of these supposed errors.</p>
<p>It is admitted, I believe, by everybody that the formal
sanctification of these spots was the act of the Empress Helena,
the mother of Constantine, but I think it is fair to suppose that
she was guided by a careful regard to the then prevailing
traditions.&nbsp; Now the nature of the ground upon which
Jerusalem stands is such, that the localities belonging to the
events there enacted might have been more easily, and
permanently, ascertained by tradition than those of any city that
I know of.&nbsp; Jerusalem, whether ancient or modern, was built
upon and surrounded by sharp, salient rocks intersected by deep
ravines.&nbsp; Up to the time of the siege Mount Calvary of
course must have been well enough known to the people of <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>Jerusalem;
the destruction of the mere buildings could not have obliterated
from any man&rsquo;s memory the names of those steep rocks and
narrow ravines in the midst of which the city had stood.&nbsp; It
seems to me, therefore, highly probable that in fixing the site
of Calvary the Empress was rightly guided.&nbsp; Recollect, too,
that the voice of tradition at Jerusalem is quite unanimous, and
that Romans, Greeks, Armenians, and Jews, all hating each other
sincerely, concur in assigning the same localities to the events
told in the Gospel.&nbsp; I concede, however, that the attempt of
the Empress to ascertain the sites of the minor events cannot be
safely relied upon.&nbsp; With respect, for instance, to the
certainty of the spot where the cock crew, I am far from being
convinced.</p>
<p>Supposing that the Empress acted arbitrarily in fixing the
holy sites, it would seem that she followed the Gospel of St.
John, and that the geography sanctioned by her can be more easily
reconciled with that history than with the accounts of the other
Evangelists.</p>
<p>The authority exercised by the Mussulman Government in
relation to the holy sites is in one view somewhat humbling to
the Christians, for it is almost as an arbitrator between the
contending sects (this always, of course, for the sake of
pecuniary advantage) that the Mussulman lends his contemptuous
aid; he not only grants, but enforces toleration.&nbsp; All
persons, of whatever religion, are allowed to go as they will
into every part of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, but in order
to prevent indecent contests, and also from motives arising out
of money payments, the Turkish Government assigns the peculiar
care of each sacred spot to one of the <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>ecclesiastic bodies.&nbsp; Since this guardianship
carries with it the receipt of the coins which the pilgrims leave
upon the shrines, it is strenuously fought for by all the rival
Churches, and the artifices of intrigue are busily exerted at
Stamboul in order to procure the issue or revocation of the
firmans by which the coveted privilege is granted.&nbsp; In this
strife the Greek Church has of late years signally triumphed, and
the most famous of the shrines are committed to the care of their
priesthood.&nbsp; They possess the golden socket in which stood
the cross of our Lord, whilst the Latins are obliged to content
themselves with the apertures in which were inserted the crosses
of the two thieves.&nbsp; They are naturally discontented with
that poor privilege, and sorrowfully look back to the days of
their former glory&mdash;the days when Napoleon was Emperor, and
Sebastiani ambassador at the Porte.&nbsp; It seems that the
&ldquo;citizen&rdquo; sultan, old Louis Philippe, has done very
little indeed for Holy Church in Palestine.</p>
<p>Although the pilgrims perform their devotions at the several
shrines with so little apparent enthusiasm, they are driven to
the verge of madness by the miracle displayed before them on
Easter Saturday.&nbsp; Then it is that the Heaven-sent fire
issues from the Holy Sepulchre.&nbsp; The pilgrims all assemble
in the great church, and already, long before the wonder is
worked, they are wrought by anticipation of God&rsquo;s sign, as
well as by their struggles for room and breathing space, to a
most frightful state of excitement.&nbsp; At length the chief
priest of the Greeks, accompanied (of all people in the world) by
the Turkish Governor, enters the tomb.&nbsp; After this, there is
a long pause, and then suddenly from out of the small apertures
on either side of the sepulchre <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>there issue long, shining
flames.&nbsp; The pilgrims now rush forward, madly struggling to
light their tapers at the holy fire.&nbsp; This is the dangerous
moment, and many lives are often lost.</p>
<p>The year before that of my going to Jerusalem, Ibrahim Pasha,
from some whim, or motive of policy, chose to witness the
miracle.&nbsp; The vast church was of course thronged, as it
always is on that awful day.&nbsp; It seems that the appearance
of the fire was delayed for a very long time, and that the
growing frenzy of the people was heightened by suspense.&nbsp;
Many, too, had already sunk under the effect of the heat and the
stifling atmosphere, when at last the fire flashed from the
sepulchre.&nbsp; Then a terrible struggle ensued; many sunk and
were crushed.&nbsp; Ibrahim had taken his station in one of the
galleries, but now, feeling perhaps his brave blood warmed by the
sight and sound of such strife, he took upon himself to quiet the
people by his personal presence, and descended into the body of
the church with only a few guards.&nbsp; He had forced his way
into the midst of the dense crowd, when unhappily he fainted
away; his guards shrieked out, and the event instantly became
known.&nbsp; A body of soldiers recklessly forced their way
through the crowd, trampling over every obstacle that they might
save the life of their general.&nbsp; Nearly two hundred people
were killed in the struggle.</p>
<p>The following year, however, the Government took better
measures for the prevention of these calamities.&nbsp; I was not
present at the ceremony, having gone away from Jerusalem some
time before, but I afterwards returned into Palestine, and I then
learned that the day had passed off without any disturbance of a
fatal kind.&nbsp; It is, however, almost too <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>much to
expect that so many ministers of peace can assemble without
finding some occasion for strife, and in that year a tribe of
wild Bedouins became the subject of discord.&nbsp; These men, it
seems, led an Arab life in some of the desert tracts bordering on
the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, but were not connected with any
of the great ruling tribes.&nbsp; Some whim or notion of policy
had induced them to embrace Christianity; but they were grossly
ignorant of the rudiments of their adopted faith, and having no
priest with them in their desert, they had as little knowledge of
religious ceremonies as of religion itself.&nbsp; They were not
even capable of conducting themselves in a place of worship with
ordinary decorum, but would interrupt the service with scandalous
cries and warlike shouts.&nbsp; Such is the account the Latins
give of them, but I have never heard the other side of the
question.&nbsp; These wild fellows, notwithstanding their entire
ignorance of all religion, are yet claimed by the Greeks, not
only as proselytes who have embraced Christianity generally, but
as converts to the particular doctrines and practice of their
Church.&nbsp; The people thus alleged to have concurred in the
great schism of the Eastern Empire are never, I believe, within
the walls of a church, or even of any building at all, except
upon this occasion of Easter; and as they then never fail to find
a row of some kind going on by the side of the sepulchre, they
fancy, it seems, that the ceremonies there enacted are funeral
games of a martial character, held in honour of a deceased
chieftain, and that a Christian festival is a peculiar kind of
battle, fought between walls, and without cavalry.&nbsp; It does
not appear, however, that these men are guilty of any ferocious
acts, or that they attempt to <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>commit depredations.&nbsp; The
charge against them is merely that by their way of applauding the
performance, by their horrible cries and frightful gestures, they
destroy the solemnity of divine service, and upon this ground the
Franciscans obtained a firman for the exclusion of such
tumultuous worshippers.&nbsp; The Greeks, however, did not choose
to lose the aid of their wild converts merely because they were a
little backward in their religious education, and they therefore
persuaded them to defy the firman by entering the city <i>en
masse</i> and overawing their enemies.&nbsp; The Franciscans, as
well as the Government authorities, were obliged to give way, and
the Arabs triumphantly marched into the church.&nbsp; The
festival, however, must have seemed to them rather flat, for
although there may have been some &ldquo;casualties&rdquo; in the
way of eyes black and noses bloody, and women
&ldquo;missing,&rdquo; there was no return of
&ldquo;killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Formerly the Latin Catholics concurred in acknowledging (but
not, I hope, in working) the annual miracle of the heavenly fire,
but they have for many years withdrawn their countenance from
this exhibition, and they now repudiate it as a trick of the
Greek Church.&nbsp; Thus of course the violence of feeling with
which the rival Churches meet at the Holy Sepulchre on Easter
Saturday is greatly increased, and a disturbance of some kind is
certain.&nbsp; In the year I speak of, though no lives were lost,
there was, as it seems, a tough struggle in the church.&nbsp; I
was amused at hearing of a taunt that was thrown that day upon an
English traveller.&nbsp; He had taken his station in a convenient
part of the church, and was no doubt displaying that peculiar air
of serenity and gratification with which an English gentleman
usually looks on at a row, when one of the Franciscans <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>came by,
all reeking from the fight, and was so disgusted at the coolness
and placid contentment of the Englishman (who was a guest at the
convent), that he forgot his monkish humility as well as the
duties of hospitality, and plainly said, &ldquo;You sleep under
our roof, you eat our bread, you drink our wine, and then when
Easter Saturday comes you don&rsquo;t fight for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet these rival Churches go on quietly enough till their blood
is up.&nbsp; The terms on which they live remind one of the
peculiar relation subsisting at Cambridge between &ldquo;town and
gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These contests and disturbances certainly do not originate
with the lay-pilgrims, the great body of whom are, as I believe,
quiet and inoffensive people.&nbsp; It is true, however, that
their pious enterprise is believed by them to operate as a
counterpoise for a multitude of sins, whether past or future, and
perhaps they exert themselves in after life to restore the
balance of good and evil.&nbsp; The Turks have a maxim which,
like most cynical apophthegms, carries with it the buzzing
trumpet of falsehood as well as the small, fine &ldquo;sting of
truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If your friend has made the pilgrimage
once, distrust him; if he has made the pilgrimage twice, cut him
dead!&rdquo;&nbsp; The caution is said to be as applicable to the
visitants of Jerusalem as to those of Mecca, but I cannot help
believing that the frailties of all the hadjis, <a
name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166"
class="citation">[166]</a> whether Christian or Mahometan, are
greatly exaggerated.&nbsp; I certainly regarded the pilgrims to
Palestine as a well-disposed orderly body of people, not strongly
enthusiastic, but desirous to comply with the ordinances of their
religion, and to attain the great end of salvation as quietly and
economically as possible.</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>When
the solemnities of Easter are concluded the pilgrims move off in
a body to complete their good work by visiting the sacred scenes
in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, including the wilderness of
John the Baptist, Bethlehem, and, above all, the Jordan, for to
bathe in those sacred waters is one of the chief objects of the
expedition.&nbsp; All the pilgrims&mdash;men, women, and
children&mdash;are submerged <i>en chemise</i>, and the saturated
linen is carefully wrapped up and preserved as a burial-dress
that shall enure for salvation in the realms of death.</p>
<p>I saw the burial of a pilgrim.&nbsp; He was a Greek, miserably
poor, and very old; he had just crawled into the Holy City, and
had reached at once the goal of his pious journey and the end of
his sufferings upon earth.&nbsp; There was no coffin nor wrapper,
and as I looked full upon the face of the dead I saw how deeply
it was rutted with the ruts of age and misery.&nbsp; The priest,
strong and portly, fresh, fat, and alive with the life of the
animal kingdom, unpaid, or ill paid for his work, would scarcely
deign to mutter out his forms, but hurried over the words with
shocking haste.&nbsp; Presently he called out impatiently,
&ldquo;Yalla!&nbsp; Goor!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Come! look sharp!), and
then the dead Greek was seized.&nbsp; His limbs yielded inertly
to the rude men that handled them, and down he went into his
grave, so roughly bundled in that his neck was twisted by the
fall, so twisted, that if the sharp malady of life were still
upon him the old man would have shrieked and groaned, and the
lines of his face would have quivered with pain.&nbsp; The lines
of his face were not moved, and the old man lay still and
heedless, so well cured of that tedious life-ache, that nothing
could hurt him now.&nbsp; His clay was <i>itself
again</i>&mdash;cool, firm, and tough.&nbsp; The pilgrim had <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>found great
rest.&nbsp; I threw the accustomed handful of the holy soil upon
his patient face, and then, and in less than a minute, the earth
closed coldly around him.</p>
<p>I did not say &ldquo;alas!&rdquo; (nobody ever does that I
know of, though the word is so frequently written).&nbsp; I
thought the old man had got rather well out of the scrape of
being alive, and poor.</p>
<p>The destruction of the mere buildings in such a place as
Jerusalem would not involve the permanent dispersion of the
inhabitants, for the rocky neighbourhood in which the town is
situate abounds in caves, which would give an easy refuge to the
people until they gained an opportunity of rebuilding their
dwellings; therefore I could not help looking upon the Jews of
Jerusalem as being in some sort the representatives, if not the
actual descendants, of the rascals who crucified our
Saviour.&nbsp; Supposing this to be the case, I felt that there
would be some interest in knowing how the events of the Gospel
history were regarded by the Israelites of modern
Jerusalem.&nbsp; The result of my inquiry upon this subject was,
so far as it went, entirely favourable to the truth of
Christianity.&nbsp; I understood that <i>the performance of the
miracles was not doubted by any of the Jews in the
place</i>.&nbsp; All of them concurred in attributing the works
of our Lord to the influence of magic, but they were divided as
to the species of enchantment from which the power
proceeded.&nbsp; The great mass of the Jewish people believe, I
fancy, that the miracles had been wrought by aid of the powers of
darkness, but many, and those the more enlightened, would call
Jesus &ldquo;the good Magician.&rdquo;&nbsp; To Europeans
repudiating the notion of all magic, good or bad, the opinion of
the Jews as to the agency <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>by which the miracles were worked is
a matter of no importance; but the circumstance of their
admitting that those miracles <i>were in fact performed</i>, is
certainly curious, and perhaps not quite immaterial. <a
name="citation169"></a><a href="#footnote169"
class="citation">[169]</a></p>
<p>If you stay in the Holy City long enough to fall into anything
like regular habits of amusement and occupation, and to become,
in short, for a time &ldquo;a man about town&rdquo; at Jerusalem,
you will necessarily lose the enthusiasm which you may have felt
when you trod the sacred soil for the first time, and it will
then seem almost strange to you to find yourself so entirely
surrounded in all your daily pursuits by the designs and sounds
of religion.&nbsp; Your hotel is a monastery, your rooms are
cells, the landlord is a stately abbot, and the waiters are
hooded monks.&nbsp; If you walk out of the town you find yourself
on the Mount of Olives, or in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, or on
the Hill of Evil Counsel.&nbsp; If you mount your horse and
extend your rambles you will be guided to the wilderness of St.
John, or the birthplace of our Saviour.&nbsp; Your club is the
great Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where everybody meets
everybody every day.&nbsp; If you lounge through the town, your
Bond Street is the Via Dolorosa, and the object of your hopeless
affections is some maid or matron all forlorn, and sadly shrouded
in her pilgrim&rsquo;s robe.&nbsp; If you would hear music, it
must be the chanting of friars; if you look at pictures, you see
virgins with mis-fore-shortened arms, or devils out of drawing,
or angels tumbling up the skies in impious perspective.&nbsp; If
you would make any purchases, you must go again to the <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>church
doors, and when you inquire for the manufactures of the place,
you find that they consist of double-blessed beads and sanctified
shells.&nbsp; These last are the favourite tokens which the
pilgrims carry off with them.&nbsp; The shell is graven, or
rather scratched, on the white side with a rude drawing of the
Blessed Virgin, or of the Crucifixion, or some other scriptural
subject.&nbsp; Having passed this stage it goes into the hands of
a priest.&nbsp; By him it is subjected to some process for
rendering it efficacious against the schemes of our ghostly
enemy.&nbsp; The manufacture is then complete, and is deemed to
be fit for use.</p>
<p>The village of Bethlehem lies prettily couched on the slope of
a hill.&nbsp; The sanctuary is a subterranean grotto, and is
committed to the joint-guardianship of the Romans, Greeks, and
Armenians, who vie with each other in adorning it.&nbsp; Beneath
an altar gorgeously decorated, and lit with everlasting fires,
there stands the low slab of stone which marks the holy site of
the Nativity; and near to this is a hollow scooped out of the
living rock.&nbsp; Here the infant Jesus was laid.&nbsp; Near the
spot of the Nativity is the rock against which the Blessed Virgin
was leaning when she presented her babe to the adoring
shepherds.</p>
<p>Many of those Protestants who are accustomed to despise
tradition consider that this sanctuary is altogether
unscriptural, that a grotto is not a stable, and that mangers are
made of wood.&nbsp; It is perfectly true, however, that the many
grottoes and caves which are found among the rocks of Judea were
formerly used for the reception of cattle.&nbsp; They are so used
at this day.&nbsp; I have myself seen grottoes appropriated to
this purpose.</p>
<p>You know what a sad and sombre decorum it is that outwardly
reigns through the lands oppressed by <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>Moslem sway.&nbsp; Mahometans make
beauty their prisoner, and enforce such a stern and gloomy
morality, or at all events, such a frightfully close semblance of
it, that far and long the wearied traveller may go without
catching one glimpse of outward happiness.&nbsp; By a strange
chance in these latter days it happened that, alone of all the
places in the land, this Bethlehem, the native village of our
Lord, escaped the moral yoke of the Mussulmans, and heard again,
after ages of dull oppression, the cheering clatter of social
freedom, and the voices of laughing girls.&nbsp; It was after an
insurrection, which had been raised against the authority of
Mehemet Ali, that Bethlehem was freed from the hateful laws of
Asiatic decorum.&nbsp; The Mussulmans of the village had taken an
active part in the movement, and when Ibrahim had quelled it, his
wrath was still so hot, that he put to death every one of the few
Mahometans of Bethlehem who had not already fled.&nbsp; The
effect produced upon the Christian inhabitants by the sudden
removal of this restraint was immense.&nbsp; The village smiled
once more.&nbsp; It is true that such sweet freedom could not
long endure.&nbsp; Even if the population of the place should
continue to be entirely Christian, the sad decorum of the
Mussulmans, or rather of the Asiatics, would sooner or later be
restored by the force of opinion and custom.&nbsp; But for a
while the sunshine would last, and when I was at Bethlehem,
though long after the flight of the Mussulmans, the cloud of
Moslem propriety had not yet come back to cast its cold shadow
upon life.&nbsp; When you reach that gladsome village, pray
Heaven there still may be heard there the voice of free, innocent
girls.&nbsp; It will sound so dearly welcome!</p>
<p>To a Christian, and thoroughbred Englishman, <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>not even
the licentiousness which generally accompanies it can compensate
for the oppressiveness of that horrible outward decorum, which
turns the cities and the palaces of Asia into deserts and
gaols.&nbsp; So, I say, when you see and hear them, those romping
girls of Bethlehem will gladden your very soul.&nbsp; Distant at
first, and then nearer and nearer the timid flock will gather
around you, with their large burning eyes gravely fixed against
yours, so that they see into your brain; and if you imagine evil
against them, they will know of your ill thought before it is yet
well born, and will fly and be gone in the moment.&nbsp; But
presently, if you will only look virtuous enough to prevent
alarm, and vicious enough to avoid looking silly, the blithe
maidens will draw nearer and nearer to you, and soon there will
be one, the bravest of the sisters, who will venture right up to
your side and touch the hem of your coat, in playful defiance of
the danger, and then the rest will follow the daring of their
youthful leader, and gather close round you, and hold a shrill
controversy on the wondrous formation that you call a hat, and
the cunning of the hands that clothed you with cloth so fine; and
then, growing more profound in their researches, they will pass
from the study of your mere dress to a serious contemplation of
your stately height, and your nut-brown hair, and the ruddy glow
of your English cheeks.&nbsp; And if they catch a glimpse of your
ungloved fingers, then again will they make the air ring with
their sweet screams of wonder and amazement, as they compare the
fairness of your hand with their warmer tints, and even with the
hues of your own sunburnt face.&nbsp; Instantly the ringleader of
the gentle rioters imagines a new sin; with tremulous boldness
she touches, then grasps your hand, and smoothes it <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>gently
betwixt her own, and pries curiously into its make and colour, as
though it were silk of Damascus, or shawl of Cashmere.&nbsp; And
when they see you even then still sage and gentle, the joyous
girls will suddenly and screamingly, and all at once, explain to
each other that you are surely quite harmless and innocent, a
lion that makes no spring, a bear that never hugs, and upon this
faith, one after the other, they will take your passive hand, and
strive to explain it, and make it a theme and a
controversy.&nbsp; But the one, the fairest and the sweetest of
all, is yet the most timid; she shrinks from the daring deeds of
her playmates, and seeks shelter behind their sleeves, and
strives to screen her glowing consciousness from the eyes that
look upon her.&nbsp; But her laughing sisters will have none of
this cowardice; they vow that the fair one <i>shall</i> be their
&rsquo;complice, <i>shall</i> share their dangers, <i>shall</i>
touch the hand of the stranger; they seize her small wrist, and
drag her forward by force, and at last, whilst yet she strives to
turn away, and to cover up her whole soul under the folds of
downcast eyelids, they vanquish her utmost strength, they
vanquish your utmost modesty, and marry her hand to yours.&nbsp;
The quick pulse springs from her fingers, and throbs like a
whisper upon your listening palm.&nbsp; For an instant her large
timid eyes are upon you; in an instant they are shrouded again,
and there comes a blush so burning, that the frightened girls
stay their shrill laughter, as though they had played too
perilously, and harmed their gentle sister.&nbsp; A moment, and
all with a sudden intelligence turn away and fly like deer, yet
soon again like deer they wheel round and return, and stand, and
gaze upon the danger, until they grow brave once more.</p>

174</span>&ldquo;I regret to observe, that the removal of the
moral restraint imposed by the presence of the Mahometan
inhabitants has led to a certain degree of boisterous, though
innocent, levity in the bearing of the Christians, and more
especially in the demeanour of those who belong to the younger
portion of the female population; but I feel assured that a more
thorough knowledge of the principles of their own pure religion

<span class="GutSmall">THE DESERT</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaza</span> is upon the verge of the
Desert, to which it stands in the same relation as a seaport to
the sea.&nbsp; It is there that you <i>charter</i> your camels
(&ldquo;the ships of the Desert&rdquo;), and lay in your stores
for the voyage.</p>
<p>These preparations kept me in the town for some days.&nbsp;
Disliking restraint, I declined making myself the guest of the
Governor (as it is usual and proper to do), but took up my
quarters at the caravanserai, or &ldquo;khan,&rdquo; as they call
it in that part of Asia.</p>
<p>Dthemetri had to make the arrangements for my journey, and in
order to arm himself with sufficient authority for doing all that
was required, he found it necessary to put himself in
communication with the Governor.&nbsp; The result of this
diplomatic intercourse was that the Governor, with his train of
attendants, came to me one day at my caravanserai, and formally
complained that Dthemetri had grossly insulted him.&nbsp; I was
shocked at this, for the man was always attentive and civil to
me, and I was disgusted at the idea of his having been rewarded
with insult.&nbsp; Dthemetri was present when the complaint was
made, and I angrily asked him whether it was true that he had
really insulted the Governor, and what the deuce he <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>meant by
it.&nbsp; This I asked with the full certainty that Dthemetri, as
a matter of course, would deny the charge, would swear that a
&ldquo;wrong construction had been put upon his words, and that
nothing was further from his thoughts,&rdquo; etc. etc., after
the manner of the parliamentary people, but to my surprise he
very plainly answered that he certainly <i>had</i> insulted the
Governor, and that rather grossly, but, he said, it was quite
necessary to do this in order to &ldquo;strike terror and inspire
respect.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Terror and respect!&nbsp; What on
earth do you mean by that nonsense?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, but
without striking terror and inspiring respect, he (Dthemetri)
would never be able to force on the arrangements for my journey,
and vossignoria would be kept at Gaza for a month!&rdquo;&nbsp;
This would have been awkward, and certainly I could not deny that
poor Dthemetri had succeeded in his odd plan of inspiring
respect, for at the very time that this explanation was going on
in Italian the Governor seemed more than ever, and more
anxiously, disposed to overwhelm me with assurances of goodwill,
and proffers of his best services.&nbsp; All this kindness, or
promise of kindness, I naturally received with courtesy&mdash;a
courtesy that greatly perturbed Dthemetri, for he evidently
feared that my civility would undo all the good that his insults
had achieved.</p>
<p>You will find, I think, that one of the greatest drawbacks to
the pleasure of travelling in Asia is the being obliged, more or
less, to make your way by bullying.&nbsp; It is true that your
own lips are not soiled by the utterance of all the mean words
that are spoken for you, and that you don&rsquo;t even know of
the sham threats, and the false promises, and the vainglorious
boasts, put forth by your dragoman; but now and then there
happens some incident of the sort which <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>I have just
been mentioning, which forces you to believe, or suspect, that
your dragoman is habitually fighting your battles for you in a
way that you can hardly bear to think of.</p>
<p>A caravanserai is not ill adapted to the purposes for which it
is meant.&nbsp; It forms the four sides of a large quadrangular
court.&nbsp; The ground floor is used for warehouses, the first
floor for guests, and the open court for the temporary reception
of the camels, as well as for the loading and unloading of their
burthens, and the transaction of mercantile business
generally.&nbsp; The apartments used for the guests are small
cells opening into a corridor, which runs round the four sides of
the court.</p>
<p>Whilst I lay near the opening of my cell looking down into the
court below, there arrived from the Desert a caravan, that is, a
large assemblage of travellers.&nbsp; It consisted chiefly of
Moldavian pilgrims, who to make their good work even more than
complete had begun by visiting the shrine of the Virgin in Egypt,
and were now going on to Jerusalem.&nbsp; They had been overtaken
in the Desert by a gale of wind, which so drove the sand and
raised up such mountains before them, that their journey had been
terribly perplexed and obstructed, and their provisions
(including water, the most precious of all) had been exhausted
long before they reached the end of their toilsome march.&nbsp;
They were sadly wayworn.&nbsp; The arrival of the caravan drew
many and various groups into the court.&nbsp; There was the
Moldavian pilgrim with his sable dress and cap of fur and heavy
masses of bushy hair; the Turk, with his various and brilliant
garments; the Arab, superbly stalking under his striped blanket,
that hung like royalty upon his stately form; the jetty Ethiopian
in his slavish frock; <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>the sleek, smooth-faced scribe with
his comely pelisse, and his silver ink-box stuck in like a dagger
at his girdle.&nbsp; And mingled with these were the camels, some
standing, some kneeling and being unladen, some twisting round
their long necks and gently stealing the straw from out of their
own pack-saddles.</p>
<p>In a couple of days I was ready to start.&nbsp; The way of
providing for the passage of the Desert is this: there is an
agent in the town who keeps himself in communication with some of
the desert Arabs that are hovering within a day&rsquo;s journey
of the place.&nbsp; A party of these upon being guaranteed
against seizure or other ill-treatment at the hands of the
Governor come into the town, bringing with them the number of
camels which you require, and then they stipulate for a certain
sum to take you to the place of your destination in a given
time.&nbsp; The agreement which they thus enter into includes a
safe conduct through their country as well as the hire of the
camels.&nbsp; According to the contract made with me I was to
reach Cairo within ten days from the commencement of the
journey.&nbsp; I had four camels, one for my baggage, one for
each of my servants, and one for myself.&nbsp; Four Arabs, the
owners of the camels, came with me on foot.&nbsp; My stores were
a small soldier&rsquo;s tent, two bags of dried bread brought
from the convent at Jerusalem, and a couple of bottles of wine
from the same source, two goatskins filled with water, tea,
sugar, a cold tongue, and (of all things in the world) a jar of
Irish butter which Mysseri had purchased from some
merchant.&nbsp; There was also a small sack of charcoal, for the
greater part of the Desert through which we were to pass is
destitute of fuel.</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>The
camel kneels to receive her load, and for a while she will allow
the packing to go on with silent resignation; but when she begins
to suspect that her master is putting more than a just burthen
upon her poor hump she turns round her supple neck and looks
sadly upon the increasing load, and then gently remonstrates
against the wrong with the sigh of a patient wife.&nbsp; If sighs
will not move you, she can weep.&nbsp; You soon learn to pity,
and soon to love, her for the sake of her gentle and womanish
ways.</p>
<p>You cannot, of course, put an English or any other riding
saddle upon the back of a camel, but your quilt or carpet, or
whatever you carry for the purpose of lying on at night, is
folded and fastened on to the pack-saddle upon the top of the
hump, and on this you ride, or rather sit.&nbsp; You sit as a man
sits on a chair when he sits astride and faces the back of
it.&nbsp; I made an improvement on this plan.&nbsp; I had my
English stirrups strapped on to the cross-bars of the
pack-saddle, and thus by gaining rest for my dangling legs, and
gaining too the power of varying my position more easily than I
could otherwise have done, I added very much to my comfort.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t forget to do as I did.</p>
<p>The camel, like the elephant, is one of the old-fashioned sort
of animals that still walk along upon the (now nearly exploded)
plan of the ancient beasts that lived before the Flood.&nbsp; She
moves forward both her near legs at the same time, and then
awkwardly swings round her off shoulder and haunch so as to
repeat the man&oelig;uvre on that side.&nbsp; Her pace,
therefore, is an odd, disjointed and disjoining, sort of movement
that is rather disagreeable at first, but you soon grow
reconciled to it.&nbsp; The height to which you are raised is of
great advantage to you in passing <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>the burning sands of the Desert, for
the air at such a distance from the ground is much cooler and
more lively than that which circulates beneath.</p>
<p>For several miles beyond Gaza the land, which had been
plentifully watered by the rains of the last week, was covered
with rich verdure, and thickly jewelled with meadow flowers so
fresh and fragrant that I began to grow almost uneasy, to fancy
that the very Desert was receding before me, and that the
long-desired adventure of passing its &ldquo;burning sands&rdquo;
was to end in a mere ride across a field.&nbsp; But as I advanced
the true character of the country began to display itself with
sufficient clearness to dispel my apprehensions, and before the
close of my first day&rsquo;s journey I had the gratification of
finding that I was surrounded on all sides by a tract of real
sand, and had nothing at all to complain of except that there
peeped forth at intervals a few isolated blades of grass, and
many of those stunted shrubs which are the accustomed food of the
camel.</p>
<p>Before sunset I came up with an encampment of Arabs (the
encampment from which my camels had been brought), and my tent
was pitched amongst theirs.&nbsp; I was now amongst the true
Bedouins.&nbsp; Almost every man of this race closely resembles
his brethren.&nbsp; Almost every man has large and finely formed
features; but his face is so thoroughly stripped of flesh, and
the white folds from his headgear fall down by his haggard cheeks
so much in the burial fashion, that he looks quite sad and
ghastly.&nbsp; His large dark orbs roll slowly and solemnly over
the white of his deep-set eyes; his countenance shows painful
thought and long-suffering, the suffering of one fallen from a
high estate.&nbsp; His gait is strangely majestic, and he marches
along with <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>his simple blanket as though he were wearing the
purple.&nbsp; His common talk is a series of piercing screams and
cries, <a name="citation181"></a><a href="#footnote181"
class="citation">[181]</a> more painful to the ear than the most
excruciating fine music that I ever endured.</p>
<p>The Bedouin women are not treasured up like the wives and
daughters of other Orientals, and indeed they seemed almost
entirely free from the restraints imposed by jealousy.&nbsp; The
feint which they made of concealing their faces from me was
always slight.&nbsp; They never, I think, wore the <i>yashmak</i>
properly fixed.&nbsp; When they first saw me they used to hold up
a part of their drapery with one hand across their faces, but
they seldom persevered very steadily in subjecting me to this
privation.&nbsp; Unhappy beings! they were sadly plain.&nbsp; The
awful haggardness that gave something of character to the faces
of the men was sheer ugliness in the poor women.&nbsp; It is a
great shame, but the truth is that, except when we refer to the
beautiful devotion of the mother to her child, all the fine
things we say and think about women apply only to those who are
tolerably good-looking or graceful.&nbsp; These Arab women were
so plain and clumsy, that they seemed to me to be fit for nothing
but another and a better world.&nbsp; They may have been good
women enough so far as relates to the exercise of the minor
virtues, but they had so grossly neglected the prime duty of
looking pretty in this transitory life, that I could not at all
forgive them.&nbsp; They seemed to feel the weight of their
guilt, and to be truly and humbly penitent.&nbsp; I had the
complete command of their affections, for at any moment I could
make their young hearts bound and their old <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>hearts jump
by offering a handful of tobacco, and yet, believe me, it was not
in the first <i>soir&eacute;e</i> that my store of Latakia was
exhausted.</p>
<p>The Bedouin women have no religion.&nbsp; This is partly the
cause of their clumsiness.&nbsp; Perhaps if from Christian girls
they would learn how to pray, their souls might become more
gentle, and their limbs be clothed with grace.</p>
<p>You who are going into their country have a direct personal
interest in knowing something about &ldquo;Arab
hospitality&rdquo;; but the deuce of it is, that the poor fellows
with whom I have happened to pitch my tent were scarcely ever in
a condition to exercise that magnanimous virtue with much
<i>&eacute;clat</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, Mysseri&rsquo;s canteen
generally enabled me to outdo my hosts in the matter of
entertainment.&nbsp; They were always courteous, however, and
were never backward in offering me the <i>youart</i>, a kind of
whey, which is the principal delicacy to be found amongst the
wandering tribes.</p>
<p>Practically, I think, Childe Harold would have found it a
dreadful bore to make &ldquo;the Desert his
dwelling-place,&rdquo; for at all events, if he adopted the life
of the Arabs he would have tasted no solitude.&nbsp; The tents
are partitioned, not so as to divide the Childe and the
&ldquo;fair spirit&rdquo; who is his &ldquo;minister&rdquo; from
the rest of the world, but so as to separate the twenty or thirty
brown men that sit screaming in the one compartment from the
fifty or sixty brown women and children that scream and squeak in
the other.&nbsp; If you adopt the Arab life for the sake of
seclusion you will be horribly disappointed, for you will find
yourself in perpetual contact with a mass of hot
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; It is true that all who are inmates of
the same tent are related to each other, <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>but I am
not quite sure that that circumstance adds much to the charm of
such a life.&nbsp; At all events, before you finally determine to
become an Arab try a gentle experiment.&nbsp; Take one of those
small, shabby houses in Mayfair, and shut yourself up in it with
forty or fifty shrill cousins for a couple of weeks in July.</p>
<p>In passing the Desert you will find your Arabs wanting to
start and to rest at all sorts of odd times.&nbsp; They like, for
instance, to be off at one in the morning, and to rest during the
whole of the afternoon.&nbsp; You must not give way to their
wishes in this respect.&nbsp; I tried their plan once, and found
it very harassing and unwholesome.&nbsp; An ordinary tent can
give you very little protection against heat, for the fire
strikes fiercely through single canvas, and you soon find that
whilst you lie crouching and striving to hide yourself from the
blazing face of the sun, his power is harder to bear than it is
where you boldly defy him from the airy heights of your
camel.</p>
<p>It had been arranged with my Arabs that they were to bring
with them all the food which they would want for themselves
during the passage of the Desert, but as we rested at the end of
the first day&rsquo;s journey by the side of an Arab encampment,
my camel men found all that they required for that night in the
tents of their own brethren.&nbsp; On the evening of the second
day, however, just before we encamped for the night, my four
Arabs came to Dthemetri, and formally announced that they had not
brought with them one atom of food, and that they looked entirely
to my supplies for their daily bread.&nbsp; This was awkward
intelligence.&nbsp; We were now just two days deep in the Desert,
and I had brought with me no more bread than might be reasonably
required for <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>myself and my European attendants.&nbsp; I believed at
the moment (for it seemed likely enough) that the men had really
mistaken the terms of the arrangement, and feeling that the bore
of being put upon half rations would be a less evil (and even to
myself a less inconvenience) than the starvation of my Arabs, I
at once told Dthemetri to assure them that my bread should be
equally shared with all.&nbsp; Dthemetri, however, did not
approve of this concession; he assured me quite positively that
the Arabs thoroughly understood the agreement, and that if they
were now without food they had wilfully brought themselves into
this strait for the wretched purpose of bettering their bargain
by the value of a few paras&rsquo; worth of bread.&nbsp; This
suggestion made me look at the affair in a new light.&nbsp; I
should have been glad enough to put up with the slight privation
to which my concession would subject me, and could have borne to
witness the semi-starvation of poor Dthemetri with a fine,
philosophical calm, but it seemed to me that the scheme, if
scheme it were, had something of audacity in it, and was well
enough calculated to try the extent of my softness.&nbsp; I well
knew the danger of allowing such a trial to result in a
conclusion that I was one who might be easily managed; and
therefore, after thoroughly satisfying myself from
Dthemetri&rsquo;s clear and repeated assertions that the Arabs
had really understood the arrangement, I determined that they
should not now violate it by taking advantage of my position in
the midst of their big Desert, so I desired Dthemetri to tell
them that they should touch no bread of mine.&nbsp; We stopped,
and the tent was pitched.&nbsp; The Arabs came to me, and prayed
loudly for bread.&nbsp; I refused them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we die!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gave the Arabs to understand that I regretted their
perishing by hunger, but that I should bear this calmly, like any
other misfortune not my own, that, in short, I was happily
resigned to <i>their</i> fate.&nbsp; The men would have talked a
great deal, but they were under the disadvantage of addressing me
through a hostile interpreter; they looked hard upon my face, but
they found no hope there; so at last they retired as they
pretended, to lay them down and die.</p>
<p>In about ten minutes from this time I found that the Arabs
were busily cooking their bread!&nbsp; Their pretence of having
brought no food was false, and was only invented for the purpose
of saving it.&nbsp; They had a good bag of meal, which they had
contrived to stow away under the baggage upon one of the camels
in such a way as to escape notice.&nbsp; In Europe the detection
of a scheme like this would have occasioned a disagreeable
feeling between the master and the delinquent, but you would no
more recoil from an Oriental on account of a matter of this sort,
than in England you would reject a horse that had tried, and
failed, to throw you.&nbsp; Indeed, I felt quite good-humouredly
towards my Arabs, because they had so woefully failed in their
wretched attempt, and because, as it turned out, I had done what
was right.&nbsp; They too, poor fellows, evidently began to like
me immensely, on account of the hard-heartedness which had
enabled me to baffle their scheme.</p>
<p>The Arabs adhere to those ancestral principles of bread-baking
which have been sanctioned by the experience of ages.&nbsp; The
very first baker of bread that ever lived must have done his work
exactly as the Arab does at this day.&nbsp; He takes some meal
and holds it out in the hollow of his hands, whilst his <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>comrade
pours over it a few drops of water; he then mashes up the
moistened flour into a paste, which he pulls into small pieces,
and thrusts into the embers.&nbsp; His way of baking exactly
resembles the craft or mystery of roasting chestnuts as practised
by children; there is the same prudence and circumspection in
choosing a good berth for the morsel, the same enterprise and
self-sacrificing valour in pulling it out with the fingers.</p>
<p>The manner of my daily march was this.&nbsp; At about an hour
before dawn I rose and made the most of about a pint of water,
which I allowed myself for washing.&nbsp; Then I breakfasted upon
tea and bread.&nbsp; As soon as the beasts were loaded I mounted
my camel and pressed forward.&nbsp; My poor Arabs, being on foot,
would sometimes moan with fatigue and pray for rest; but I was
anxious to enable them to perform their contract for bringing me
to Cairo within the stipulated time, and I did not therefore
allow a halt until the evening came.&nbsp; About midday, or soon
after, Mysseri used to bring up his camel alongside of mine, and
supply me with a piece of bread softened in water (for it was
dried hard like board), and also (as long as it lasted) with a
piece of the tongue; after this there came into my hand (how well
I remember it) the little tin cup half-filled with wine and
water.</p>
<p>As long as you are journeying in the interior of the Desert
you have no particular point to make for as your
resting-place.&nbsp; The endless sands yield nothing but small
stunted shrubs; even these fail after the first two or three
days, and from that time you pass over broad plains, you pass
over newly reared hills, you pass through valleys that the storm
of the last week has dug, and the hills and the valleys are <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>sand, sand,
sand, still sand, and only sand, and sand and sand again.&nbsp;
The earth is so samely that your eyes turn towards
heaven&mdash;towards heaven, I mean, in the sense of sky.&nbsp;
You look to the sun, for he is your taskmaster, and by him you
know the measure of the work that you have done, and the measure
of the work that remains for you to do.&nbsp; He comes when you
strike your tent in the early morning, and then, for the first
hour of the day as you move forward on your camel, he stands at
your near side and makes you know that the whole day&rsquo;s toil
is before you; then for a while, and a long while, you see him no
more, for you are veiled and shrouded, and dare not look upon the
greatness of his glory, but you know where he strides overhead by
the touch of his flaming sword.&nbsp; No words are spoken, but
your Arabs moan, your camels sigh, your skin glows, your
shoulders ache, and for sights you see the pattern and the web of
the silk that veils your eyes and the glare of the outer
light.&nbsp; Time labours on; your skin glows and your shoulders
ache, your Arabs moan, your camels sigh, and you see the same
pattern in the silk, and the same glare of light beyond, but
conquering Time marches on, and by and by the descending sun has
compassed the heaven, and now softly touches your right arm, and
throws your lank shadow over the sand right along on the way to
Persia.&nbsp; Then again you look upon his face, for his power is
all veiled in his beauty, and the redness of flames has become
the redness of roses; the fair, wavy cloud that fled in the
morning now comes to his sight once more, comes blushing, yet
still comes on, comes burning with blushes, yet hastens and
clings to his side.</p>
<p>Then arrives your time for resting.&nbsp; The world <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>about you
is all your own, and there, where you will, you pitch your
solitary tent; there is no living thing to dispute your
choice.&nbsp; When at last the spot had been fixed upon and we
came to a halt, one of the Arabs would touch the chest of my
camel and utter at the same time a peculiar gurgling sound.&nbsp;
The beast instantly understood and obeyed the sign, and slowly
sunk under me till she brought her body to a level with the
ground, then gladly enough I alighted.&nbsp; The rest of the
camels were unloaded and turned loose to browse upon the shrubs
of the desert, where shrubs there were, or where these failed, to
wait for the small quantity of food that was allowed them out of
our stores.</p>
<p>My servants, helped by the Arabs, busied themselves in
pitching the tent and kindling the fire.&nbsp; Whilst this was
doing I used to walk away towards the east, confiding in the
print of my foot as a guide for my return.&nbsp; Apart from the
cheering voices of my attendants I could better know and feel the
loneliness of the Desert.&nbsp; The influence of such scenes,
however, was not of a softening kind, but filled me rather with a
sort of childish exultation in the self-sufficiency which enabled
me to stand thus alone in the wideness of Asia&mdash;a shortlived
pride, for wherever man wanders he still remains tethered by the
chain that links him to his kind; and so when the night closed
around me I began to return, to return, as it were, to my own
gate.&nbsp; Reaching at last some high ground I could see, and
see with delight, the fire of our small encampment, and when at
last I regained the spot it seemed to me a very home that had
sprung up for me in the midst of these solitudes.&nbsp; My Arabs
were busy with their bread; Mysseri rattling teacups; the little
kettle, with her <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>odd old-maidish looks, sat humming away old songs about
England; and two or three yards from the fire my tent stood prim
and tight, with open portal, and with welcoming look, like
&ldquo;the old arm-chair&rdquo; of our lyrist&rsquo;s
&ldquo;sweet Lady Anne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the beginning of my journey the night breeze blew coldly;
when that happened, the dry sand was heaped up outside round the
skirts of the tent, and so the wind, that everywhere else could
sweep as he listed along those dreary plains, was forced to turn
aside in his course and make way, as he ought, for the
Englishman.&nbsp; Then within my tent there were heaps of
luxuries&mdash;dining-rooms, dressing-rooms, libraries, bedrooms,
drawing-rooms, oratories, all crowded into the space of a
hearthrug.&nbsp; The first night, I remember, with my books and
maps about me, I wanted light; they brought me a taper, and
immediately from out of the silent Desert there rushed in a flood
of life unseen before.&nbsp; Monsters of moths, of all shapes and
hues, that never before perhaps had looked upon the shining of a
flame, now madly thronged into my tent, and dashed through the
fire of the candle till they fairly extinguished it with their
burning limbs.&nbsp; Those who had failed in attaining this
martyrdom suddenly became serious, and clung despondingly to the
canvas.</p>
<p>By and by there was brought to me the fragrant tea and big
masses of scorched and scorching toast, and the butter that had
come all the way to me in this Desert of Asia from out of that
poor, dear, starving Ireland.&nbsp; I feasted like a king, like
four kings, like a boy in the fourth form.</p>
<p>When the cold, sullen morning dawned, and my people began to
load the camels, I always felt loath to give back to the waste
this little spot of ground that <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>had glowed for a while with the
cheerfulness of a human dwelling.&nbsp; One by one the cloaks,
the saddles, the baggage, the hundred things that strewed the
ground and made it look so familiar&mdash;all these were taken
away and laid upon the camels.&nbsp; A speck in the broad tracts
of Asia remained still impressed with the mark of patent
portmanteaus and the heels of London boots; the embers of the
fire lay black and cold upon the sand, and these were the signs
we left.</p>
<p>My tent was spared to the last, but when all else was ready
for the start then came its fall; the pegs were drawn, the canvas
shivered, and in less than a minute there was nothing that
remained of my genial home but only a pole and a bundle.&nbsp;
The encroaching Englishman was off, and instant upon the fall of
the canvas, like an owner who had waited and watched, the genius
of the Desert stalked in.</p>
<p>To servants, as I suppose of any other Europeans not much
accustomed to amuse themselves by fancy or memory, it often
happens that after a few days journeying the loneliness of the
Desert will become frightfully oppressive.&nbsp; Upon my poor
fellows the access of melancholy came heavy, and all at once, as
a blow from above; they bent their necks, and bore it as best
they could, but their joy was great on the fifth day when we came
to an oasis called Gatieh, for here we found encamped a caravan
(that is, an assemblage of travellers) from Cairo.&nbsp; The
Orientals living in cities never pass the Desert except in this
way; many will wait for weeks, and even for months, until a
sufficient number of persons can be found ready to undertake the
journey at the same time&mdash;until the flock of sheep is big
enough to fancy itself a match for wolves.&nbsp; They could not,
I think, <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>really secure themselves against any serious danger by
this contrivance, for though they have arms, they are so little
accustomed to use them, and so utterly unorganised, that they
never could make good their resistance to robbers of the
slightest respectability.&nbsp; It is not of the Bedouins that
such travellers are afraid, for the safe conduct granted by the
chief of the ruling tribe is never, I believe, violated, but it
is said that there are deserters and scamps of various sorts who
hover about the skirts of the Desert, particularly on the Cairo
side, and are anxious to succeed to the property of any poor
devils whom they may find more weak and defenceless than
themselves.</p>
<p>These people from Cairo professed to be amazed at the
ludicrous disproportion between their numerical forces and
mine.&nbsp; They could not understand, and they wanted to know,
by what strange privilege it is that an Englishman with a brace
of pistols and a couple of servants rides safely across the
Desert, whilst they, the natives of the neighbouring cities, are
forced to travel in troops, or rather in herds.&nbsp; One of them
got a few minutes of private conversation with Dthemetri, and
ventured to ask him anxiously whether the English did not travel
under the protection of evil demons.&nbsp; I had previously known
(from Methley, I think, who had travelled in Persia) that this
notion, so conducive to the safety of our countrymen, is
generally prevalent amongst Orientals.&nbsp; It owes its origin,
partly to the strong wilfulness of the English gentleman (which
not being backed by any visible authority, either civil or
military, seems perfectly superhuman to the soft Asiatic), but
partly too to the magic of the banking system, by force of which
the wealthy traveller will <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>make all his journeys without
carrying a handful of coin, and yet when he arrives at a city
will rain down showers of gold.&nbsp; The theory is, that the
English traveller has committed some sin against God and his
conscience, and that for this the evil spirit has hold of him,
and drives him from his home like a victim of the old Grecian
furies, and forces him to travel over countries far and strange,
and most chiefly over deserts and desolate places, and to stand
upon the sites of cities that once were and are now no more, and
to grope among the tombs of dead men.&nbsp; Often enough there is
something of truth in this notion; often enough the wandering
Englishman is guilty (if guilt it be) of some pride or ambition,
big or small, imperial or parochial, which being offended has
made the lone place more tolerable than ballrooms to him, a
sinner.</p>
<p>I can understand the sort of amazement of the Orientals at the
scantiness of the retinue with which an Englishman passes the
Desert, for I was somewhat struck myself when I saw one of my
countrymen making his way across the wilderness in this simple
style.&nbsp; At first there was a mere moving speck on the
horizon.&nbsp; My party of course became all alive with
excitement, and there were many surmises.&nbsp; Soon it appeared
that three laden camels were approaching, and that two of them
carried riders.&nbsp; In a little while we saw that one of the
riders wore European dress, and at last the travellers were
pronounced to be an English gentleman and his servant.&nbsp; By
their side there were a couple, I think, of Arabs on foot, and
this was the whole party.</p>
<p>You, you love sailing; in returning from a cruise to the
English coast you see often enough a fisherman&rsquo;s humble
boat far away from all shores, with an <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>ugly black
sky above and an angry sea beneath.&nbsp; You watch the grizzly
old man at the helm carrying his craft with strange skill through
the turmoil of waters, and the boy, supple-limbed, yet
weather-worn already, and with steady eyes that look through the
blast, you see him understanding commandments from the jerk of
his father&rsquo;s white eyebrow, now belaying and now letting
go, now scrunching himself down into mere ballast, or baling out
death with a pipkin.&nbsp; Stale enough is the sight, and yet
when I see it I always stare anew, and with a kind of Titanic
exultation, because that a poor boat with the brain of a man and
the hands of a boy on board can match herself so bravely against
black heaven and ocean.&nbsp; Well, so when you have travelled
for days and days over an Eastern desert without meeting the
likeness of a human being, and then at last see an English
shooting-jacket and his servant come listlessly slouching along
from out of the forward horizon, you stare at the wide
unproportion between this slender company and the boundless
plains of sand through which they are keeping their way.</p>
<p>This Englishman, as I afterwards found, was a military man
returning to his country from India, and crossing the Desert at
this part in order to go through Palestine.&nbsp; As for me, I
had come pretty straight from England, and so here we met in the
wilderness at about half-way from our respective
starting-points.&nbsp; As we approached each other it became with
me a question whether we should speak.&nbsp; I thought it likely
that the stranger would accost me, and in the event of his doing
so I was quite ready to be as sociable and chatty as I could be
according to my nature; but still I could not think of anything
particular that I had to say to him.&nbsp; Of course, among
civilised <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>people the not having anything to say is no excuse at
all for not speaking, but I was shy and indolent, and I felt no
great wish to stop and talk like a morning visitor in the midst
of those broad solitudes.&nbsp; The traveller perhaps felt as I
did, for except that we lifted our hands to our caps and waved
our arms in courtesy, we passed each other as if we had passed in
Bond Street.&nbsp; Our attendants, however, were not to be
cheated of the delight that they felt in speaking to new
listeners and hearing fresh voices once more.&nbsp; The masters,
therefore, had no sooner passed each other than their respective
servants quietly stopped and entered into conversation.&nbsp; As
soon as my camel found that her companions were not following her
she caught the social feeling and refused to go on.&nbsp; I felt
the absurdity of the situation, and determined to accost the
stranger if only to avoid the awkwardness of remaining stuck fast
in the Desert whilst our servants were amusing themselves.&nbsp;
When with this intent I turned round my camel I found that the
gallant officer who had passed me by about thirty or forty yards
was exactly in the same predicament as myself.&nbsp; I put my now
willing camel in motion and rode up towards the stranger, who
seeing this followed my example and came forward to meet
me.&nbsp; He was the first to speak.&nbsp; He was much too
courteous to address me as if he admitted the possibility of my
wishing to accost him from any feeling of mere sociability or
civilian-like love of vain talk.&nbsp; On the contrary, he at
once attributed my advances to a laudable wish of acquiring
statistical information, and accordingly, when we got within
speaking distance, he said, &ldquo;I daresay you wish to know how
the plague is going on at Cairo?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he went on
to say, he regretted that his information did <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>not enable
him to give me in numbers a perfectly accurate statement of the
daily deaths.&nbsp; He afterwards talked pleasantly enough upon
other and less ghastly subjects.&nbsp; I thought him manly and
intelligent, a worthy one of the few thousand strong Englishmen
to whom the empire of India is committed.</p>
<p>The night after the meeting with the people of the caravan,
Dthemetri, alarmed by their warnings, took upon himself to keep
watch all night in the tent.&nbsp; No robbers came except a
jackal, that poked his nose into my tent from some motive of
rational curiosity.&nbsp; Dthemetri did not shoot him for fear of
waking me.&nbsp; These brutes swarm in every part of Syria, and
there were many of them even in the midst of the void sands that
would seem to give such poor promise of food.&nbsp; I can hardly
tell what prey they could be hoping for, unless it were that they
might find now and then the carcass of some camel that had died
on the journey.&nbsp; They do not marshal themselves into great
packs like the wild dogs of Eastern cities, but follow their prey
in families, like the place-hunters of Europe.&nbsp; Their voices
are frightfully like to the shouts and cries of human
beings.&nbsp; If you lie awake in your tent at night you are
almost continually hearing some hungry family as it sweeps along
in full cry.&nbsp; You hear the exulting scream with which the
sagacious dam first winds the carrion, and the shrill response of
the unanimous cubs as they sniff the tainted air, &ldquo;Wha!
wha! wha! wha! wha! wha!&nbsp; Whose gift is it in,
mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once during this passage my Arabs lost their way among the
hills of loose sand that surrounded us, but after a while we were
lucky enough to recover our right line of march.&nbsp; The same
day we fell in with <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>a Sheik, the head of a family, that
actually dwells at no great distance from this part of the Desert
during nine months of the year.&nbsp; The man carried a
matchlock, of which he was very proud.&nbsp; We stopped and sat
down and rested a while for the sake of a little talk.&nbsp;
There was much that I should have liked to ask this man, but he
could not understand Dthemetri&rsquo;s language, and the process
of getting at his knowledge by double interpretation through my
Arabs was unsatisfactory.&nbsp; I discovered, however (and my
Arabs knew of that fact), that this man and his family lived
habitually for nine months of the year without touching or seeing
either bread or water.&nbsp; The stunted shrub growing at
intervals through the sand in this part of the Desert enables the
camel mares to yield a little milk, which furnishes the sole food
and drink of their owner and his people.&nbsp; During the other
three months (the hottest of the months, I suppose) even this
resource fails, and then the Sheik and his people are forced to
pass into another district.&nbsp; You would ask me why the man
should not remain always in that district which supplies him with
water during three months of the year, but I don&rsquo;t know
enough of Arab politics to answer the question.&nbsp; The Sheik
was not a good specimen of the effect produced by the diet to
which he is subjected.&nbsp; He was very small, very spare, and
sadly shrivelled, a poor, over-roasted snipe, a mere cinder of a
man.&nbsp; I made him sit down by my side, and gave him a piece
of bread and a cup of water from out of my goatskins.&nbsp; This
was not very tempting drink to look at, for it had become turbid,
and was deeply reddened by some colouring matter contained in the
skins, but it kept its sweetness, and tasted like a strong
decoction of Russia leather.&nbsp; The Sheik sipped this, drop by
drop, <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>with ineffable relish, and rolled his eyes solemnly
round between every draught, as though the drink were the drink
of the Prophet, and had come from the seventh heaven.</p>
<p>An inquiry about distances led to the discovery that this
Sheik had never heard of the division of time into hours; my
Arabs themselves, I think, were rather surprised at this.</p>
<p>About this part of my journey I saw the likeness of a
fresh-water lake.&nbsp; I saw, as it seemed, a broad sheet of
calm water, that stretched far and fair towards the south,
stretching deep into winding creeks, and hemmed in by jutting
promontories, and shelving smooth off towards the shallow
side.&nbsp; On its bosom the reflected fire of the sun lay
playing, and seeming to float upon waters deep and still.</p>
<p>Though I knew of the cheat, it was not till the spongy foot of
my camel had almost trodden in the seeming waters that I could
undeceive my eyes, for the shore-line was quite true and
natural.&nbsp; I soon saw the cause of the phantasm.&nbsp; A
sheet of water heavily impregnated with salts had filled this
great hollow, and when dried up by evaporation had left a white
saline deposit, that exactly marked the space which the waters
had covered, and thus sketched a good shore-line.&nbsp; The
minute crystals of the salt sparkled in the sun, and so looked
like the face of a lake that is calm and smooth.</p>
<p>The pace of the camel is irksome, and makes your shoulders and
loins ache from the peculiar way in which you are obliged to suit
yourself to the movements of the beast, but you soon, of course,
become inured to this, and after the first two days this way of
travelling became so familiar to me, that (poor sleeper as I am)
I now and then slumbered for some <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>moments together on the back of my
camel.&nbsp; On the fifth day of my journey the air above lay
dead, and all the whole earth that I could reach with my utmost
sight and keenest listening was still and lifeless as some
dispeopled and forgotten world that rolls round and round in the
heavens through wasted floods of light.&nbsp; The sun, growing
fiercer and fiercer, shone down more mightily now than ever on me
he shone before, and as I dropped my head under his fire, and
closed my eyes against the glare that surrounded me, I slowly
fell asleep, for how many minutes or moments I cannot tell, but
after a while I was gently awakened by a peal of church bells, my
native bells, the innocent bells of Marlen, that never before
sent forth their music beyond the Blaygon hills!&nbsp; My first
idea naturally was that I still remained fast under the power of
a dream.&nbsp; I roused myself and drew aside the silk that
covered my eyes, and plunged my bare face into the light.&nbsp;
Then at least I was well enough wakened, but still those old
Marlen bells rung on, not ringing for joy, but properly, prosily,
steadily, merrily ringing &ldquo;for church.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a
while the sound died away slowly.&nbsp; It happened that neither
I nor any of my party had a watch by which to measure the exact
time of its lasting, but it seemed to me that about ten minutes
had passed before the bells ceased.&nbsp; I attributed the effect
to the great heat of the sun, the perfect dryness of the clear
air through which I moved, and the deep stillness of all around
me.&nbsp; It seemed to me that these causes, by occasioning a
great tension, and consequent susceptibility, of the hearing
organs, had rendered them liable to tingle under the passing
touch of some mere memory that must have swept across my brain in
a moment of sleep.&nbsp; Since my return to <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>England it
has been told me that like sounds have been heard at sea, and
that the sailor becalmed under a vertical sun in the midst of the
wide ocean has listened in trembling wonder to the chime of his
own village bells.</p>
<p>At this time I kept a poor shabby pretence of a journal, which
just enabled me to know the day of the month and the week
according to the European calendar, and when in my tent at night
I got out my pocket-book I found that the day was Sunday, and
roughly allowing for the difference of time in this longitude, I
concluded that at the moment of my hearing that strange peal the
church-going bells of Marlen must have been actually calling the
prim congregation of the parish to morning prayer.&nbsp; The
coincidence amused me faintly, but I could not pluck up the least
hope that the effect which I had experienced was anything other
than an illusion, an illusion liable to be explained (as every
illusion is in these days) by some of the philosophers who guess
at Nature&rsquo;s riddles.&nbsp; It would have been sweeter to
believe that my kneeling mother by some pious enchantment had
asked, and found, this spell to rouse me from my scandalous
forgetfulness of God&rsquo;s holy day, but my fancy was too weak
to carry a faith like that.&nbsp; Indeed, the vale through which
the bells of Marlen send their song is a highly respectable vale,
and its people (save one, two, or three) are wholly unaddicted to
the practice of magical arts.</p>
<p>After the fifth day of my journey I no longer travelled over
shifting hills, but came upon a dead level, a dead level bed of
sand, quite hard, and studded with small shining pebbles.</p>
<p>The heat grew fierce; there was no valley nor hollow, no hill,
no mound, no shadow of hill nor of <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>mound, by which I could mark the way
I was making.&nbsp; Hour by hour I advanced, and saw no
change&mdash;I was still the very centre of a round horizon; hour
by hour I advanced, and still there was the same, and the same,
and the same&mdash;the same circle of flaming sky&mdash;the same
circle of sand still glaring with light and fire.&nbsp; Over all
the heaven above, over all the earth beneath, there was no
visible power that could balk the fierce will of the sun:
&ldquo;he rejoiced as a strong man to run a race; his going forth
was from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of
it; and there was nothing hid from the heat thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp;
From pole to pole, and from the east to the west, he brandished
his fiery sceptre as though he had usurped all heaven and
earth.&nbsp; As he bid the soft Persian in ancient times, so now,
and fiercely too, he bid me bow down and worship him; so now in
his pride he seemed to command me, and say, &ldquo;Thou shalt
have none other gods but me.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was all alone before
him.&nbsp; There were these two pitted together, and face to
face&mdash;the mighty sun for one, and for the other this poor,
pale, solitary self of mine, that I always carry about with
me.</p>
<p>But on the eighth day, and before I had yet turned away from
Jehovah for the glittering god of the Persians, there appeared a
dark line upon the edge of the forward horizon, and soon the line
deepened into a delicate fringe, that sparkled here and there as
though it were sewn with diamonds.&nbsp; There, then, before me
were the gardens and the minarets of Egypt and the mighty works
of the Nile, and I (the eternal Ego that I am!)&mdash;I had lived
to see, and I saw them.</p>
<p>When evening came I was still within the confines of the
Desert, and my tent was pitched as usual; but <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>one of my
Arabs stalked away rapidly towards the west, without telling me
of the errand on which he was bent.&nbsp; After a while he
returned; he had toiled on a graceful service; he had travelled
all the way on to the border of the living world, and brought me
back for token an ear of rice, full, fresh, and green. The next
day I entered upon Egypt, and floated along (for the delight was
as the delight of bathing) through green wavy fields of rice, and
pastures fresh and plentiful, and dived into the cold verdure of
groves and gardens, and quenched my hot eyes in shade, as though
in deep, rushing waters.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">CAIRO AND THE PLAGUE </span><a
name="citation202"></a><a href="#footnote202"
class="citation">[202]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Cairo</span> and plague!&nbsp; During the
whole time of my stay the plague was so master of the city, and
showed itself so staringly in every street and every alley, that
I can&rsquo;t now affect to dissociate the two ideas.</p>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>When
coming from the Desert I rode through a village which lies near
to the city on the eastern side, there approached me with busy
face and earnest gestures a personage in the Turkish dress.&nbsp;
His long flowing beard gave him rather a majestic look, but his
briskness of manner, and his visible anxiety to accost me, seemed
strange in an Oriental.&nbsp; The man in fact was French, or of
French origin, and his object was to warn me of the plague, and
prevent me from entering the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arr&ecirc;tez-vous, monsieur, je vous en
prie&mdash;arr&ecirc;tez-vous; il ne faut pas entrer dans la
ville; la peste y r&egrave;gne partout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, je sais, <a name="citation203a"></a><a
href="#footnote203a" class="citation">[203a]</a>
mais&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mais monsieur, je dis la peste&mdash;la peste;
c&rsquo;est de <span class="GutSmall">LA PESTE</span> qu&rsquo;il
est question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, je sais, mais&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mais monsieur, je dis encore <span class="GutSmall">LA
PESTE</span>&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">LA PESTE</span>.&nbsp;
Je vous conjure de ne pas entrer dans la ville&mdash;vous seriaz
dans une ville empest&eacute;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, je sais, mais&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mais monsieur, je dois donc vous avertir tout bonnement
que si vous entrez dans la ville, vous serez&mdash;enfin vous
serez <span class="GutSmall">COMPROMIS</span>!&rdquo; <a
name="citation203b"></a><a href="#footnote203b"
class="citation">[203b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, je sais, mais&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>The
Frenchman was at last convinced that it was vain to reason with a
mere Englishman, who could not understand what it was to be
&ldquo;compromised.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thanked him most sincerely for
his kindly meant warning; in hot countries it is very unusual
indeed for a man to go out in the glare of the sun and give free
advice to a stranger.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Cairo I summoned Osman Effendi, who was, as
I knew, the owner of several houses, and would be able to provide
me with apartments.&nbsp; He had no difficulty in doing this, for
there was not one European traveller in Cairo besides
myself.&nbsp; Poor Osman! he met me with a sorrowful countenance,
for the fear of the plague sat heavily on his soul.&nbsp; He
seemed as if he felt that he was doing wrong in lending me a
resting-place, and he betrayed such a listlessness about temporal
matters, as one might look for in a man who believed that his
days were numbered.&nbsp; He caught me too soon after my arrival
coming out from the public baths, <a name="citation204"></a><a
href="#footnote204" class="citation">[204]</a> and from that time
forward he was sadly afraid of me, for he shared the opinions of
Europeans with respect to the effect of contagion.</p>
<p>Osman&rsquo;s history is a curious one.&nbsp; He was a
Scotchman born, and when very young, being then a drummer-boy, he
landed in Egypt with Fraser&rsquo;s force.&nbsp; He was taken
prisoner, and according to Mahometan custom, the alternative of
death or the Koran was offered to him; he did not choose death,
<a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>and
therefore went through the ceremonies which were necessary for
turning him into a good Mahometan.&nbsp; But what amused me most
in his history was this, that very soon after having embraced
Islam he was obliged in practice to become curious and
discriminating in his new faith, to make war upon Mahometan
dissenters, and follow the orthodox standard of the Prophet in
fierce campaigns against the Wahabees, <a
name="citation205"></a><a href="#footnote205"
class="citation">[205]</a> who are the Unitarians of the
Mussulman world.&nbsp; The Wahabees were crushed, and Osman
returning home in triumph from his holy wars, began to flourish
in the world.&nbsp; He acquired property, and became
<i>effendi</i>, or gentleman.&nbsp; At the time of my visit to
Cairo he seemed to be much respected by his brother Mahometans,
and gave pledge of his sincere alienation from Christianity by
keeping a couple of wives.&nbsp; He affected the same sort of
reserve in mentioning them as is generally shown by
Orientals.&nbsp; He invited me, indeed, to see his harem, but he
made both his wives bundle out before I was admitted.&nbsp; He
felt, as it seemed to me, that neither of them would bear
criticism, and I think that this idea, rather than any motive of
sincere jealousy, induced him to keep them out of sight.&nbsp;
The rooms of the harem reminded me of an English nursery rather
than of a Mahometan paradise.&nbsp; One is apt to judge of a
woman before one sees her by the air of elegance or coarseness
with which she surrounds her home; I judged Osman&rsquo;s wives
by this test, and condemned them both.&nbsp; But the strangest
feature in Osman&rsquo;s character was his inextinguishable
nationality.&nbsp; In vain they had brought him over the seas in
early boyhood; in vain had he suffered captivity, conversion,
circumcision; in vain they had passed him through fire in their
<a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>Arabian
campaigns, they could not cut away or burn out poor Osman&rsquo;s
inborn love of all that was Scotch; in vain men called him
Effendi; in vain he swept along in Eastern robes; in vain the
rival wives adorned his harem: the joy of his heart still plainly
lay in this, that he had three shelves of books, and that the
books were thoroughbred Scotch&mdash;the Edinburgh this, the
Edinburgh that, and above all, I recollect, he prided himself
upon the &ldquo;Edinburgh Cabinet Library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fear of the plague is its forerunner.&nbsp; It is likely
enough that at the time of my seeing poor Osman the deadly taint
was beginning to creep through his veins, but it was not till
after I had left Cairo that he was visibly stricken.&nbsp; He
died.</p>
<p>As soon as I had seen all that I wanted to see in Cairo and in
the neighbourhood I wished to make my escape from a city that lay
under the terrible curse of the plague, but Mysseri fell ill, in
consequence, I believe, of the hardships which he had been
suffering in my service.&nbsp; After a while he recovered
sufficiently to undertake a journey, but then there was some
difficulty in procuring beasts of burthen, and it was not till
the nineteenth day of my sojourn that I quitted the city.</p>
<p>During all this time the power of the plague was rapidly
increasing.&nbsp; When I first arrived, it was said that the
daily number of &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; by plague, out of a
population of about two hundred thousand, did not exceed four or
five hundred, but before I went away the deaths were reckoned at
twelve hundred a day.&nbsp; I had no means of knowing whether the
numbers (given out, as I believe they were, by officials) were at
all correct, but I could not help knowing that from day to day
the number of the <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>dead was increasing.&nbsp; My quarters were in a street
which was one of the chief thoroughfares of the city.&nbsp; The
funerals in Cairo take place between daybreak and noon, and as I
was generally in my rooms during this part of the day, I could
form some opinion as to the briskness of the plague.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mean this for a sly insinuation that I got up every
morning with the sun.&nbsp; It was not so; but the funerals of
most people in decent circumstances at Cairo are attended by
singers and howlers, and the performances of these people woke me
in the early morning, and prevented me from remaining in
ignorance of what was going on in the street below.</p>
<p>These funerals were very simply conducted.&nbsp; The bier was
a shallow wooden tray, carried upon a light and weak wooden
frame.&nbsp; The tray had, in general, no lid, but the body was
more or less hidden from view by a shawl or scarf.&nbsp; The
whole was borne upon the shoulders of men, who contrived to cut
along with their burthen at a great pace.&nbsp; Two or three
singers generally preceded the bier; the howlers (who are paid
for their vocal labours) followed after, and last of all came
such of the dead man&rsquo;s friends and relations as could keep
up with such a rapid procession; these, especially the women,
would get terribly blown, and would straggle back into the rear;
many were fairly &ldquo;beaten off.&rdquo;&nbsp; I never observed
any appearance of mourning in the mourners: the pace was too
severe for any solemn affectation of grief. <a
name="citation207"></a><a href="#footnote207"
class="citation">[207]</a></p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>When
first I arrived at Cairo the funerals that daily passed under my
windows were many, but still there were frequent and long
intervals without a single howl.&nbsp; Every day, however (except
one, when I fancied that I observed a diminution of funerals),
these intervals became less frequent and shorter, and at last,
the passing of the howlers from morn till noon was almost
incessant.&nbsp; I believe that about one-half of the whole
people was carried off by this visitation.&nbsp; The Orientals,
however, have more quiet fortitude than Europeans under
afflictions of this sort, and they never allow the plague to
interfere with their religious usages.&nbsp; I rode one day round
the great burial-ground.&nbsp; The tombs are strewed over a great
expanse, among the vast mountains of rubbish (the accumulations
of many centuries) which surround the city.&nbsp; The ground,
unlike the Turkish &ldquo;cities of the dead,&rdquo; which are
made so beautiful by their dark cypresses, has nothing to sweeten
melancholy, nothing to mitigate the odiousness of death.&nbsp;
Carnivorous beasts and birds possess the place by night, and now
in the fair morning it was all alive with fresh
comers&mdash;alive with dead.&nbsp; Yet at this very time, when
the plague was raging so furiously, and on this very ground,
which resounded so mournfully with the howls of arriving
funerals, preparations were going on for the religious festival
called the Kourban Bairam.&nbsp; Tents were pitched, and
<i>swings hung for the amusement of children</i>&mdash;a <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>ghastly
holiday; but the Mahometans take a pride, and a just pride, in
following their ancient customs undisturbed by the shadow of
death.</p>
<p>I did not hear, whilst I was at Cairo, that any prayer for a
remission of the plague had been offered up in the mosques.&nbsp;
I believe that however frightful the ravages of the disease may
be, the Mahometans refrain from approaching Heaven with their
complaints until the plague has endured for a long space, and
then at last they pray God, not that the plague may cease, but
that it may go to another city!</p>
<p>A good Mussulman seems to take pride in repudiating the
European notion that the will of God can be eluded by eluding the
touch of a sleeve.&nbsp; When I went to see the pyramids of
Sakkara I was the guest of a noble old fellow, an Osmanlee, whose
soft rolling language it was a luxury to hear after suffering, as
I had suffered of late, from the shrieking tongue of the
Arabs.&nbsp; This man was aware of the European ideas about
contagion, and his first care therefore was to assure me that not
a single instance of plague had occurred in his village.&nbsp; He
then inquired as to the progress of the plague at Cairo.&nbsp; I
had but a bad account to give.&nbsp; Up to this time my host had
carefully refrained from touching me out of respect to the
European theory of contagion, but as soon as it was made plain
that he, and not I, would be the person endangered by contact, he
gently laid his hand upon my arm, in order to make me feel sure
that the circumstance of my coming from an infected city did not
occasion him the least uneasiness.&nbsp; In that touch there was
true hospitality.</p>
<p>Very different is the faith and the practice of the Europeans,
or rather, I mean of the Europeans settled in the East, and
commonly called Levantines.&nbsp; <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>When I came to the end of my journey
over the Desert I had been so long alone, that the prospect of
speaking to somebody at Cairo seemed almost a new
excitement.&nbsp; I felt a sort of consciousness that I had a
little of the wild beast about me, but I was quite in the humour
to be charmingly tame, and to be quite engaging in my manners, if
I should have an opportunity of holding communion with any of the
human race whilst at Cairo.&nbsp; I knew no one in the place, and
had no letters of introduction, but I carried letters of credit,
and it often happens in places remote from England that those
&ldquo;advices&rdquo; operate as a sort of introduction, and
obtain for the bearer (if disposed to receive them) such ordinary
civilities as it may be in the power of the banker to offer.</p>
<p>Very soon after my arrival I went to the house of the
Levantine to whom my credentials were addressed.&nbsp; At his
door several persons (all Arabs) were hanging about and keeping
guard.&nbsp; It was not till after some delay, and the passing of
some communications with those in the interior of the citadel,
that I was admitted.&nbsp; At length, however, I was conducted
through the court, and up a flight of stairs, and finally into
the apartment where business was transacted.&nbsp; The room was
divided by an excellent, substantial fence of iron bars, and
behind this grille the banker had his station.&nbsp; The truth
was, that from fear of the plague he had adopted the course
usually taken by European residents, and had shut himself up
&ldquo;in strict quarantine&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, that he
had, as he hoped, cut himself off from all communication with
infecting substances.&nbsp; The Europeans long resident in the
East, without any, or with scarcely any, exception, are firmly
convinced that the plague is propagated by contact, and by <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>contact
only; that if they can but avoid the touch of an infecting
substance they are safe, and that if they cannot, they die.&nbsp;
This belief induces them to adopt the contrivance of putting
themselves in that state of siege which they call
&ldquo;quarantine.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a part of their faith that
metals, and hempen rope, and also, I fancy, one or two other
substances, will not carry the infection; and they likewise
believe that the germ of pestilence, which lies in an infected
substance, may be destroyed by submersion in water, or by the
action of smoke.&nbsp; They therefore guard the doors of their
houses with the utmost care against intrusion, and condemn
themselves, with all the members of their family, including any
European servants, to a strict imprisonment within the walls of
their dwelling.&nbsp; Their native attendants are not allowed to
enter at all, but they make the necessary purchases of
provisions, which are hauled up through one of the windows by
means of a rope, and are then soaked in water.</p>
<p>I knew nothing of these mysteries, and was not therefore
prepared for the sort of reception which I met with.&nbsp; I
advanced to the iron fence, and putting my letter between the
bars, politely proffered it to Mr. Banker.&nbsp; Mr. Banker
received me with a sad and dejected look, and not &ldquo;with
open arms,&rdquo; or with any arms at all, but with&mdash;a pair
of tongs!&nbsp; I placed my letter between the iron fingers,
which picked it up as if it were a viper, and conveyed it away to
be scorched and purified by fire and smoke.&nbsp; I was disgusted
at this reception, and at the idea that anything of mine could
carry infection to the poor wretch who stood on the other side of
the grille, pale and trembling, and already meet for death.&nbsp;
I looked with something of the Mahometan&rsquo;s <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>feeling
upon these little contrivances for eluding fate; and in this
instance, at least, they were vain.&nbsp; A few more days, and
the poor money-changer, who had striven to guard the days of his
life (as though they were coins) with bolts and bars of
iron&mdash;he was seized by the plague, and he died.</p>
<p>To people entertaining such opinions as these respecting the
fatal effect of contact, the narrow and crowded streets of Cairo
were terrible as the easy slope that leads to Avernus.&nbsp; The
roaring ocean and the beetling crags owe something of their
sublimity to this&mdash;that if they be tempted, they can take
the warm life of a man.&nbsp; To the contagionist, filled as he
is with the dread of final causes, having no faith in destiny nor
in the fixed will of God, and with none of the devil-may-care
indifference which might stand him instead of creeds&mdash;to
such one, every rag that shivers in the breeze of a
plague-stricken city has this sort of sublimity.&nbsp; If by any
terrible ordinance he be forced to venture forth, he sees death
dangling from every sleeve, and as he creeps forward, he poises
his shuddering limbs between the imminent jacket that is stabbing
at his right elbow and the murderous pelisse that threatens to
mow him clean down as it sweeps along on his left.&nbsp; But most
of all, he dreads that which most of all he should love&mdash;the
touch of a woman&rsquo;s dress; for mothers and wives, hurrying
forth on kindly errands from the bedsides of the dying, go
slouching along through the streets more wilfully and less
courteously than the men.&nbsp; For a while it may be that the
caution of the poor Levantine may enable him to avoid contact,
but sooner or later perhaps the dreaded chance arrives; that
bundle of linen, with the dark tearful eyes at the top of it,
that labours along with the voluptuous clumsiness of <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>Grisi&mdash;she has touched the poor Levantine with the
hem of her sleeve!&nbsp; From that dread moment his peace is
gone; his mind, for ever hanging upon the fatal touch, invites
the blow which he fears.&nbsp; He watches for the symptoms of
plague so carefully, that sooner or later they come in
truth.&nbsp; The parched mouth is a sign&mdash;his mouth
<i>is</i> parched; the throbbing brain&mdash;his brain
<i>does</i> throb; the rapid pulse&mdash;he touches his own wrist
(for he dares not ask counsel of any man lest he be deserted), he
touches his wrist, and feels how his frighted blood goes
galloping out of his heart; there is nothing but the fatal
swelling that is wanting to make his sad conviction complete;
immediately he has an odd feel under the arm&mdash;no pain, but a
little straining of the skin; he would to God it were his fancy
that were strong enough to give him that sensation.&nbsp; This is
the worst of all; it now seems to him that he could be happy and
contented with his parched mouth and his throbbing brain and his
rapid pulse, if only he could know that there were no swelling
under the left arm; but dare he try?&mdash;In a moment of
calmness and deliberation he dares not, but when for a while he
has writhed under the torture of suspense, a sudden strength of
will drives him to seek and know his fate.&nbsp; He touches the
gland, and finds the skin sane and sound, but under the cuticle
there lies a small lump like a pistol-bullet, that moves as he
pushes it.&nbsp; Oh! but is this for all certainty, is this the
sentence of death?&nbsp; Feel the gland of the other arm; there
is not the same lump exactly, yet something a little like it:
have not some people glands naturally enlarged?&mdash;would to
Heaven he were one!&nbsp; So he does for himself the work of the
plague, and when the Angel of Death, thus courted, does indeed
and in truth <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>come, he has only to finish that which has been so well
begun; he passes his fiery hand over the brain of the victim, and
lets him rave for a season, but all chance-wise, of people and
things once dear, or of people and things indifferent.&nbsp; Once
more the poor fellow is back at his home in fair Provence, and
sees the sun-dial that stood in his childhood&rsquo;s garden;
sees part of his mother, and the long-since-forgotten face of
that little dead sister (he sees her, he says, on a Sunday
morning, for all the church bells are ringing); he looks up and
down through the universe, and owns it well piled with bales upon
bales of cotton, and cotton eternal&mdash;so much so that he
feels, he knows, he swears he could make that winning hazard, if
the billiard table would not slant upwards, and if the cue were a
cue worth playing with; but it is not&mdash;it&rsquo;s a cue that
won&rsquo;t move&mdash;his own arm won&rsquo;t move&mdash;in
short, there&rsquo;s the devil to pay in the brain of the poor
Levantine, and perhaps the next night but one he becomes the
&ldquo;life and the soul&rdquo; of some squalling jackal family
who fish him out by the foot from his shallow and sandy
grave.</p>
<p>Better fate was mine.&nbsp; By some happy perverseness
(occasioned perhaps by my disgust at the notion of being received
with a pair of tongs) I took it into my pleasant head that all
the European notions about contagion were thoroughly unfounded;
that the plague might be providential or &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo;
(as they phrase it), but was not contagious; and that I could not
be killed by the touch of a woman&rsquo;s sleeve, nor yet by her
blessed breath.&nbsp; I therefore determined that the plague
should not alter my habits and amusements in any one
respect.&nbsp; Though I came to this resolve from impulse, I
think that I took the course which was in effect the most
prudent, for the <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>cheerfulness of spirits which I was thus enabled to
retain discouraged the yellow-winged angel, and prevented him
from taking a shot at me.&nbsp; I, however, so far respected the
opinion of the Europeans, that I avoided touching when I could do
so without privation or inconvenience.&nbsp; This endeavour
furnished me with a sort of amusement as I passed through the
streets.&nbsp; The usual mode of moving from place to place in
the city of Cairo is upon donkeys, of which great numbers are
always in readiness, with donkey-boys attached.&nbsp; I had two
who constantly (until one of them died of the plague) waited at
my door upon the chance of being wanted.&nbsp; I found this way
of moving about exceedingly pleasant, and never attempted any
other.&nbsp; I had only to mount my beast, and tell my donkey-boy
the point for which I was bound, and instantly I began to glide
on at a capital pace.&nbsp; The streets of Cairo are not paved in
any way, but strewed with a dry sandy soil, so deadening to
sound, that the footfall of my donkey could scarcely be
heard.&nbsp; There is no <i>trottoir</i>, and as you ride through
the streets you mingle with the people on foot.&nbsp; Those who
are in your way, upon being warned by the shouts of the
donkey-boy, move very slightly aside, so as to leave you a narrow
lane, through which you pass at a gallop.&nbsp; In this way you
glide on delightfully in the very midst of crowds, without being
inconvenienced or stopped for a moment.&nbsp; It seems to you
that it is not the donkey but the donkey-boy who wafts you on
with his shouts through pleasant groups, and air that feels thick
with the fragrance of burial spice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eh! Sheik, Eh!
Bint,&mdash;reggalek,&mdash;shumalek,&rdquo; etc.
etc.&mdash;&ldquo;O old man, O virgin, get out of the way on the
right&mdash;O virgin, O old man, get out of way on the <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>left&mdash;this Englishman comes, he comes, he
comes!&rdquo;&nbsp; The narrow alley which these shouts cleared
for my passage made it possible, though difficult, to go on for a
long way without touching a single person, and my endeavours to
avoid such contact were a sort of game for me in my loneliness,
which was not without interest.&nbsp; If I got through a street
without being touched, I won; if I was touched, I lost&mdash;lost
a deuce of stake, according to the theory of the Europeans; but
that I deemed to be all nonsense&mdash;I only lost that game, and
would certainly win the next.</p>
<p>There is not much in the way of public buildings to admire at
Cairo, but I saw one handsome mosque, to which an instructive
history is attached.&nbsp; A Hindustanee merchant having amassed
an immense fortune settled in Cairo, and soon found that his
riches in the then state of the political world gave him vast
power in the city&mdash;power, however, the exercise of which was
much restrained by the counteracting influence of other wealthy
men.&nbsp; With a view to extinguish every attempt at rivalry the
Hindustanee merchant built this magnificent mosque at his own
expense.&nbsp; When the work was complete, he invited all the
leading men of the city to join him in prayer within the walls of
the newly built temple, and he then caused to be massacred all
those who were sufficiently influential to cause him any jealousy
or uneasiness&mdash;in short, all &ldquo;the respectable
men&rdquo; of the place; after this he possessed undisputed power
in the city and was greatly revered&mdash;he is revered to this
day.&nbsp; It seemed to me that there was a touching simplicity
in the mode which this man so successfully adopted for gaining
the confidence and goodwill of his fellow-citizens.&nbsp; There
seems to be some <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>improbability in the story (though not nearly so gross
as it might appear to an European ignorant of the East, for
witness Mehemet Ali&rsquo;s destruction of the Mamelukes, a
closely similar act, and attended with the like brilliant
success), <a name="citation217"></a><a href="#footnote217"
class="citation">[217]</a> but even if the story be false as a
mere fact, it is perfectly true as an illustration&mdash;it is a
true exposition of the means by which the respect and affection
of Orientals may be conciliated.</p>
<p>I ascended one day to the citadel, which commands a superb
view of the town.&nbsp; The fanciful and elaborate gilt-work of
the many minarets gives a light and florid grace to the city as
seen from this height, but before you can look for many seconds
at such things your eyes are drawn westward&mdash;drawn westward
and over the Nile, till they rest upon the massive enormities of
the Ghizeh Pyramids.</p>
<p>I saw within the fortress many yoke of men all haggard and
woebegone, and a kennel of very fine lions well fed and
flourishing: I say <i>yoke</i> of men, for the poor fellows were
working together in bonds; I say a <i>kennel</i> of lions, for
the beasts were not enclosed in cages, but simply chained up like
dogs.</p>
<p>I went round the bazaars: it seemed to me that pipes and arms
were cheaper here than at Constantinople, and I should advise you
therefore if you go to both places to prefer the market of
Cairo.&nbsp; I had previously bought several of such things at
Constantinople, and did not choose to encumber myself, or to
speak more honestly, I did not choose to disencumber my purse by
making any more purchases.&nbsp; In the open slave-market I saw
about <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>fifty girls exposed for sale, but all of them black, or
&ldquo;invisible&rdquo; brown.&nbsp; A slave agent took me to
some rooms in the upper storey of the building, and also into
several obscure houses in the neighbourhood, with a view to show
me some white women.&nbsp; The owners raised various objections
to the display of their ware, and well they might, for I had not
the least notion of purchasing; some refused on account of the
illegality of the proceeding, <a name="citation218"></a><a
href="#footnote218" class="citation">[218]</a> and others
declared that all transactions of this sort were completely out
of the question as long as the plague was raging.&nbsp; I only
succeeded in seeing one white slave who was for sale, but on this
one the owner affected to set an immense value, and raised my
expectations to a high pitch by saying that the girl was
Circassian, and was &ldquo;fair as the full moon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After a good deal of delay I was at last led into a room, at the
farther end of which was that mass of white linen which indicates
an Eastern woman.&nbsp; She was bid to uncover her face, and I
presently saw that, though very far from being good-looking,
according to my notion of beauty, she had not been inaptly
described by the man who compared her to the full moon, for her
large face was perfectly round and perfectly white.&nbsp; Though
very young, she was nevertheless extremely fat.&nbsp; She gave me
the idea of having been got up for sale, of having been fattened
and whitened by medicines or by some peculiar diet.&nbsp; I was
firmly determined not to see any more of her than the face.&nbsp;
She was perhaps disgusted at this my virtuous resolve, as well as
with my personal appearance; perhaps she saw my distaste and
disappointment; perhaps she wished to gain favour with her owner
by showing her attachment <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>to his faith: at all events, she
holloaed out very lustily and very decidedly that &ldquo;she
would not be bought by the infidel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst I remained at Cairo I thought it worth while to see
something of the magicians, because I considered that these men
were in some sort the descendants of those who contended so
stoutly against the superior power of Aaron.&nbsp; I therefore
sent for an old man who was held to be the chief of the
magicians, and desired him to show me the wonders of his
art.&nbsp; The old man looked and dressed his character
exceedingly well; the vast turban, the flowing beard, and the
ample robes were all that one could wish in the way of
appearance.&nbsp; The first experiment (a very stale one) which
he attempted to perform for me was that of showing the forms and
faces of my absent friends, not to me, but to a boy brought in
from the streets for the purpose, and said to be chosen at
random.&nbsp; A <i>mangale</i> (pan of burning charcoal) was
brought into my room, and the magician bending over it, sprinkled
upon the fire some substances which must have consisted partly of
spices or sweetly burning woods, for immediately a fragrant smoke
arose that curled around the bending form of the wizard, the
while that he pronounced his first incantations.&nbsp; When these
were over the boy was made to sit down, and a common green shade
was bound over his brow; then the wizard took ink, and still
continuing his incantations, wrote certain mysterious figures
upon the boy&rsquo;s palm, and directed him to rivet his
attention to these marks without looking aside for an
instant.&nbsp; Again the incantations proceeded, and after a
while the boy, being seemingly a little agitated, was asked
whether he saw anything on the palm of his hand.&nbsp; He
declared that he saw <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>a kind of military procession, with
flags and banners, which he described rather minutely.&nbsp; I
was then called upon to name the absent person whose form was to
be made visible.&nbsp; I named Keate.&nbsp; You were not at Eton,
and I must tell you, therefore, what manner of man it was that I
named, though I think you must have some idea of him already, for
wherever from utmost Canada to Bundelcund&mdash;wherever there
was the whitewashed wall of an officer&rsquo;s room, or of any
other apartment in which English gentlemen are forced to kick
their heels, there likely enough (in the days of his reign) the
head of Keate would be seen scratched or drawn with those various
degrees of skill which one observes in the representations of
saints.&nbsp; Anybody without the least notion of drawing could
still draw a speaking, nay scolding, likeness of Keate.&nbsp; If
you had no pencil, you could draw him well enough with a poker,
or the leg of a chair, or the smoke of a candle.&nbsp; He was
little more (if more at all) than five feet in height, and was
not very great in girth, but in this space was concentrated the
pluck of ten battalions.&nbsp; He had a really noble voice, which
he could modulate with great skill, but he had also the power of
quacking like an angry duck, and he almost always adopted this
mode of communication in order to inspire respect.&nbsp; He was a
capital scholar, but his ingenuous learning had <i>not</i>
&ldquo;softened his manners&rdquo; and <i>had</i>
&ldquo;permitted them to be fierce&rdquo;&mdash;tremendously
fierce; he had the most complete command over his temper&mdash;I
mean over his <i>good</i> temper, which he scarcely ever allowed
to appear: you could not put him out of humour&mdash;that is, out
of the <i>ill</i>-humour which he thought to be fitting for a
headmaster.&nbsp; His red shaggy <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>eyebrows were so prominent, that he
habitually used them as arms and hands for the purpose of
pointing out any object towards which he wished to direct
attention; the rest of his features were equally striking in
their way, and were all and all his own; he wore a fancy-dress
partly resembling the costume of Napoleon, and partly that of a
widow-woman.&nbsp; I could not by any possibility have named
anybody more decidedly differing in appearance from the rest of
the human race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you name?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I name John
Keate.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Now, what do you see?&rdquo; said the
wizard to the boy.&mdash;&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; answered the boy,
&ldquo;I see a fair girl with golden hair, blue eyes, pallid
face, rosy lips.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>There</i> was a shot!&nbsp; I
shouted out my laughter to the horror of the wizard, who
perceiving the grossness of his failure, declared that the boy
must have known sin (for none but the innocent can see truth),
and accordingly kicked him downstairs.</p>
<p>One or two other boys were tried, but none could &ldquo;see
truth&rdquo;; they all made sadly &ldquo;bad shots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the failure of these experiments, I wished to
see what sort of mummery my magician would practise if I called
upon him to show me some performances of a higher order than
those which had been attempted.&nbsp; I therefore entered into a
treaty with him, in virtue of which he was to descend with me
into the tombs near the Pyramids, and there evoke the
devil.&nbsp; The negotiation lasted some time, for Dthemetri, as
in duty bound, tried to beat down the wizard as much as he could,
and the wizard, on his part, manfully stuck up for his price,
declaring that to raise the devil was really no joke, and
insinuating that to do so was an awesome crime.&nbsp; I let <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>Dthemetri
have his way in the negotiation, but I felt in reality very
indifferent about the sum to be paid, and for this reason,
namely, that the payment (except a very small present which I
might make or not, as I chose) was to be <i>contingent on
success</i>.&nbsp; At length the bargain was made, and it was
arranged that after a few days, to be allowed for preparation,
the wizard should raise the devil for two pounds ten, play or
pay&mdash;no devil, no piastres.</p>
<p>The wizard failed to keep his appointment.&nbsp; I sent to
know why the deuce he had not come to raise the devil.&nbsp; The
truth was, that my Mahomet had gone to the mountain.&nbsp; The
plague had seized him, and he died.</p>
<p>Although the plague had now spread terrible havoc around me, I
did not see very plainly any corresponding change in the looks of
the streets until the seventh day after my arrival.&nbsp; I then
first observed that the city was <i>silenced</i>.&nbsp; There
were no outward signs of despair nor of violent terror, but many
of the voices that had swelled the busy hum of men were already
hushed in death, and the survivors, so used to scream and screech
in their earnestness whenever they bought or sold, now showed an
unwonted indifference about the affairs of this world: it was
less worth while for men to haggle and haggle, and crack the sky
with noisy bargains, when the great commander was there, who
could &ldquo;pay all their debts with the roll of his
drum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time I was informed that of twenty-five thousand
people at Alexandria, twelve thousand had died already; the
destroyer had come rather later to Cairo, but there was nothing
of weariness in his strides.&nbsp; The deaths came faster than
ever they befell in the plague of London; but the calmness of <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>Orientals
under such visitations, and the habit of using biers for
interment, instead of burying coffins along with the bodies,
rendered it practicable to dispose of the dead in the usual way,
without shocking the people by any unaccustomed spectacle of
horror.&nbsp; There was no tumbling of bodies into carts, as in
the plague of Florence and the plague of London.&nbsp; Every man,
according to his station, was properly buried, and that in the
usual way, except that he went to his grave in a more hurried
pace than might have been adopted under ordinary
circumstances.</p>
<p>The funerals which poured through the streets were not the
only public evidence of deaths.&nbsp; In Cairo this custom
prevails: At the instant of a man&rsquo;s death (if his property
is sufficient to justify the expense) professional howlers are
employed.&nbsp; I believe that these persons are brought near to
the dying man when his end appears to be approaching, and the
moment that life is gone they lift up their voices and send forth
a loud wail from the chamber of death.&nbsp; Thus I knew when my
near neighbours died; sometimes the howls were near, sometimes
more distant.&nbsp; Once I was awakened in the night by the wail
of death in the next house, and another time by a like howl from
the house opposite; and there were two or three minutes, I
recollect, during which the howl seemed to be actually
<i>running</i> along the street.</p>
<p>I happened to be rather teased at this time by a sore throat,
and I thought it would be well to get it cured if I could before
I again started on my travels.&nbsp; I therefore inquired for a
Frank doctor, and was informed that the only one then at Cairo
was a young Bolognese refugee, who was so poor that he had not <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>been able
to take flight, as the other medical men had done.&nbsp; At such
a time as this it was out of the question to <i>send</i> for a
European physician; a person thus summoned would be sure to
suppose that the patient was ill of the plague, and would decline
to come.&nbsp; I therefore rode to the young doctor&rsquo;s
residence.&nbsp; After experiencing some little difficulty in
finding where to look for him, I ascended a flight or two of
stairs and knocked at his door.&nbsp; No one came immediately,
but after some little delay the medico himself opened the door,
and admitted me.&nbsp; I of course made him understand that I had
come to consult him, but before entering upon my throat grievance
I accepted a chair, and exchanged a sentence or two of
commonplace conversation.&nbsp; Now the natural commonplace of
the city at this season was of a gloomy sort, &ldquo;Come va la
peste?&rdquo; (how goes the plague?) and this was precisely the
question I put.&nbsp; A deep sigh, and the words, &ldquo;Sette
cento per giorno, signor&rdquo; (seven hundred a day), pronounced
in a tone of the deepest sadness and dejection, were the answer I
received.&nbsp; The day was not oppressively hot, yet I saw that
the doctor was perspiring profusely, and even the outside surface
of the thick shawl dressing-gown, in which he had wrapped
himself, appeared to be moist.&nbsp; He was a handsome,
pleasant-looking young fellow, but the deep melancholy of his
tone did not tempt me to prolong the conversation, and without
further delay I requested that my throat might be looked
at.&nbsp; The medico held my chin in the usual way, and examined
my throat.&nbsp; He then wrote me a prescription, and almost
immediately afterwards I bade him farewell, but as he conducted
me towards the door I observed an expression of strange and
unhappy watchfulness in <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>his rolling eyes.&nbsp; It was not
the next day, but the next day but one, if I rightly remember,
that I sent to request another interview with my doctor.&nbsp; In
due time Dthemetri, who was my messenger, returned, looking sadly
aghast&mdash;he had &ldquo;<i>met</i> the medico,&rdquo; for so
he phrased it, &ldquo;coming out from his house&mdash;in a
bier!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was of course plain that when the poor Bolognese was
looking at my throat, and almost mingling his breath with mine,
he was stricken of the plague.&nbsp; I suppose that the violent
sweat in which I found him had been produced by some medicine,
which he must have taken in the hope of curing himself.&nbsp; The
peculiar rolling of the eyes which I had remarked is, I believe,
to experienced observers, a pretty sure test of the plague.&nbsp;
A Russian acquaintance of mine, speaking from the information of
men who had made the Turkish campaigns of 1828 and 1829, told me
that by this sign the officers of Sabalkansky&rsquo;s force were
able to make out the plague-stricken soldiers with a good deal of
certainty.</p>
<p>It so happened that most of the people with whom I had
anything to do during my stay at Cairo were seized with plague,
and all these died.&nbsp; Since I had been for a long time <i>en
route</i> before I reached Egypt, and was about to start again
for another long journey over the Desert, there were of course
many little matters touching my wardrobe and my travelling
equipments which required to be attended to whilst I remained in
the city.&nbsp; It happened so many times that Dthemetri&rsquo;s
orders in respect to these matters were frustrated by the deaths
of the tradespeople and others whom he employed, that at last I
became quite accustomed to the peculiar manner which he assumed
when he prepared to announce a new death <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>to
me.&nbsp; The poor fellow naturally supposed that I should feel
some uneasiness at hearing of the &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; which
happened to persons employed by me, and he therefore communicated
their deaths as though they were the deaths of friends.&nbsp; He
would cast down his eyes and look like a man abashed, and then
gently, and with a mournful gesture, allow the words,
&ldquo;Morto, signor,&rdquo; to come through his lips.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know how many of such instances occurred, but they
were several, and besides these (as I told you before), my
banker, my doctor, my landlord, and my magician all died of the
plague.&nbsp; A lad who acted as a helper in the house which I
occupied lost a brother and a sister within a few hours.&nbsp;
Out of my two established donkey-boys, one died.&nbsp; I did not
hear of any instance in which a plague-stricken patient had
recovered.</p>
<p>Going out one morning I met unexpectedly the scorching breath
of the kamsin wind, and fearing that I should faint under the
horrible sensations which it caused, I returned to my
rooms.&nbsp; Reflecting, however, that I might have to encounter
this wind in the Desert, where there would be no possibility of
avoiding it, I thought it would be better to brave it once more
in the city, and to try whether I could really bear it or
not.&nbsp; I therefore mounted my ass and rode to old Cairo, and
along the gardens by the banks of the Nile.&nbsp; The wind was
hot to the touch, as though it came from a furnace.&nbsp; It blew
strongly, but yet with such perfect steadiness, that the trees
bending under its force remained fixed in the same curves without
perceptibly waving.&nbsp; The whole sky was obscured by a veil of
yellowish grey, that shut out the face of the sun.&nbsp; The
streets were utterly silent, being indeed almost entirely
deserted; and <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>not without cause, for the scorching blast, whilst it
fevers the blood, closes up the pores of the skin, and is
terribly distressing, therefore, to every animal that encounters
it.&nbsp; I returned to my rooms dreadfully ill.&nbsp; My head
ached with a burning pain, and my pulse bounded quick and
fitfully, but perhaps (as in the instance of the poor Levantine,
whose death I was mentioning) the fear and excitement which I
felt in trying my own wrist may have made my blood flutter the
faster.</p>
<p>It is a thoroughly well believed theory, that during the
continuance of the plague you can&rsquo;t be ill of any other
febrile malady&mdash;an unpleasant privilege that! for ill I was,
and ill of fever, and I anxiously wished that the ailment might
turn out to be anything rather than plague.&nbsp; I had some
right to surmise that my illness may have been merely the effect
of the hot wind; and this notion was encouraged by the elasticity
of my spirits, and by a strong forefeeling that much of my
destined life in this world was yet to come, and yet to be
fulfilled.&nbsp; That was my instinctive belief, but when I
carefully weighed the probabilities on the one side and on the
other, I could not help seeing that the strength of argument was
all against me.&nbsp; There was a strong antecedent likelihood in
<i>favour</i> of my being struck by the same blow as the rest of
the people who had been dying around me.&nbsp; Besides, it
occurred to me that, after all, the universal opinion of the
Europeans upon a medical question, such as that of contagion,
might probably be correct, and <i>if it were</i>, I was so
thoroughly &ldquo;compromised,&rdquo; and especially by the touch
and breath of the dying medico, that I had no right to expect any
other fate than that which now seemed to have overtaken me.&nbsp;
Balancing as well as <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>I could all the considerations which
hope and fear suggested, I slowly and reluctantly came to the
conclusion that, according to all merely reasonable probability,
the plague had come upon me.</p>
<p>You would suppose that this conviction would have induced me
to write a few farewell lines to those who were dearest, and that
having done that, I should have turned my thoughts towards the
world to come.&nbsp; Such, however, was not the case.&nbsp; I
believe that the prospect of death often brings with it strong
anxieties about matters of comparatively trivial import, and
certainly with me the whole energy of the mind was directed
towards the one petty object of concealing my illness until the
latest possible moment&mdash;until the delirious stage.&nbsp; I
did not believe that either Mysseri or Dthemetri, who had served
me so faithfully in all trials, would have deserted me (as most
Europeans are wont to do) when they knew that I was stricken by
plague, but I shrank from the idea of putting them to this test,
and I dreaded the consternation which the knowledge of my illness
would be sure to occasion.</p>
<p>I was very ill indeed at the moment when my dinner was served,
and my soul sickened at the sight of the food; but I had luckily
the habit of dispensing with the attendance of servants during my
meal, and as soon as I was left alone I made a melancholy
calculation of the quantity of food which I should have eaten if
I had been in my usual health, and filled my plates accordingly,
and gave myself salt, and so on, as though I were going to
dine.&nbsp; I then transferred the viands to a piece of the
omnipresent <i>Times</i> newspaper, and hid them away in a
cupboard, for it was not yet night, and I dared not throw the
food into the street until darkness came.&nbsp; I did not <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>at all
relish this process of fictitious dining, but at length the cloth
was removed, and I gladly reclined on my divan (I would not lie
down) with the <i>Arabian Nights</i> in my hand.</p>
<p>I had a feeling that tea would be a capital thing for me, but
I would not order it until the usual hour.&nbsp; When at last the
time came, I drank deep draughts from the fragrant cup.&nbsp; The
effect was almost instantaneous.&nbsp; A plenteous sweat burst
through my skin, and watered my clothes through and
through.&nbsp; I kept myself thickly covered.&nbsp; The hot,
tormenting weight which had been loading my brain was slowly
heaved away.&nbsp; The fever was extinguished.&nbsp; I felt a new
buoyancy of spirits, and an unusual activity of mind.&nbsp; I
went into my bed under a load of thick covering, and when the
morning came, and I asked myself how I was, I found that I was
thoroughly well.</p>
<p>I was very anxious to procure, if possible, some medical
advice for Mysseri, whose illness prevented my departure.&nbsp;
Every one of the European practising doctors, of whom there had
been many, had either died or fled.&nbsp; It was said, however,
that there was an Englishman in the medical service of the Pasha
who quietly remained at his post, but that he never engaged in
private practice.&nbsp; I determined to try if I could obtain
assistance in this quarter.&nbsp; I did not venture at first, and
at such a time as this, to ask him to visit a servant who was
prostrate on the bed of sickness, but thinking that I might thus
gain an opportunity of persuading him to attend Mysseri, I wrote
a note mentioning my own affair of the sore throat, and asking
for the benefit of his medical advice.&nbsp; He instantly
followed back my messenger, and was at once shown up into my
room.&nbsp; I <a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>entreated him to stand off, telling him fairly how
deeply I was &ldquo;compromised,&rdquo; and especially by my
contact with a person actually ill and since dead of
plague.&nbsp; The generous fellow, with a good-humoured laugh at
the terrors of the contagionists, marched straight up to me, and
forcibly seized my hand, and shook it with manly violence.&nbsp;
I felt grateful indeed, and swelled with fresh pride of race
because that my countryman could carry himself so nobly.&nbsp; He
soon cured Mysseri as well as me, and all this he did from no
other motives than the pleasure of doing a kindness and the
delight of braving a danger.</p>
<p>At length the great difficulty <a name="citation230"></a><a
href="#footnote230" class="citation">[230]</a> which I had had in
procuring beasts for my departure was overcome, and now, too, I
was to have the new excitement of travelling on
dromedaries.&nbsp; With two of these beasts and three camels I
gladly wound my way from out of the pest-stricken city.&nbsp; As
I passed through the streets I observed a fanatical-looking
elder, who stretched forth his arms, and lifted up his voice in a
speech which seemed to have some reference to me.&nbsp; Requiring
an interpretation, I found that the man had said, &ldquo;The
Pasha seeks camels, and he finds them not; the Englishman says,
&lsquo;Let camels be brought,&rsquo; and behold, there they
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I no sooner breathed the free, wholesome air of the Desert
than I felt that a great burden which I had been scarcely
conscious of bearing was lifted away from my mind.&nbsp; For
nearly three weeks I had lived under peril of death; the peril
ceased, and not till then did I know how much alarm and anxiety I
had really been suffering.</p>

231</span>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PYRAMIDS</span></h2>
<p>I went to see and to explore the Pyramids.</p>
<p>Familiar to one from the days of early childhood are the forms
of the Egyptian Pyramids, and now, as I approached them from the
banks of the Nile, I had no print, no picture before me, and yet
the old shapes were there; there was no change; they were just as
I had always known them.&nbsp; I straightened myself in my
stirrups, and strived to persuade my understanding that this was
real Egypt, and that those angles which stood up between me and
the West were of harder stuff, and more ancient than the paper
pyramids of the green portfolio.&nbsp; Yet it was not till I came
to the base of the great Pyramid that reality began to weigh upon
my mind.&nbsp; Strange to say, the bigness of the distinct blocks
of stones was the first sign by which I attained to feel the
immensity of the whole pile.&nbsp; When I came, and trod, and
touched with my hands, and climbed, in order that by climbing I
might come to the top of one single stone, then, and almost
suddenly, a cold sense and understanding of the Pyramid&rsquo;s
enormity came down, overcasting my brain.</p>
<p>Now try to endure this homely, sick-nursish illustration of
the effect produced upon one&rsquo;s mind <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>by the mere
vastness of the great Pyramid.&nbsp; When I was very young
(between the ages, I believe, of three and five years old), being
then of delicate health, I was often in time of night the victim
of a strange kind of mental oppression.&nbsp; I lay in my bed
perfectly conscious, and with open eyes, but without power to
speak or to move, and all the while my brain was oppressed to
distraction by the presence of a single and abstract idea, the
idea of solid immensity.&nbsp; It seemed to me in my agonies that
the horror of this visitation arose from its coming upon me
without form or shape, that the close presence of the direst
monster ever bred in hell would have been a thousand times more
tolerable than that simple idea of solid size.&nbsp; My aching
mind was fixed and riveted down upon the mere quality of
vastness, vastness, vastness, and was not permitted to invest
with it any particular object.&nbsp; If I could have done so, the
torment would have ceased.&nbsp; When at last I was roused from
this state of suffering, I could not of course in those days
(knowing no verbal metaphysics, and no metaphysics at all, except
by the dreadful experience of an abstract idea)&mdash;I could not
of course find words to describe the nature of my sensations, and
even now I cannot explain why it is that the forced contemplation
of a mere quality, distinct from matter, should be so
terrible.&nbsp; Well, now my eyes saw and knew, and my hands and
my feet informed my understanding that there was nothing at all
abstract about the great Pyramid&mdash;it was a big triangle,
sufficiently concrete, easy to see, and rough to the touch; it
could not, of course, affect me with the peculiar sensation which
I have been talking of, but yet there was something akin to that
old nightmare agony in the terrible <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>completeness with which a mere mass
of masonry could fill and load my mind.</p>
<p>And Time too; the remoteness of its origin, no less than the
enormity of its proportions, screens an Egyptian Pyramid from the
easy and familiar contact of our modern minds; at its base the
common earth ends, and all above is a world&mdash;one not created
of God, not seeming to be made by men&rsquo;s hands, but rather
the sheer giant-work of some old dismal age weighing down this
younger planet.</p>
<p>Fine sayings! but the truth seems to be after all, that the
Pyramids are quite of this world; that they were piled up into
the air for the realisation of some kingly crotchets about
immortality, some priestly longing for burial fees; and that as
for the building, they were built like coral rocks by swarms of
insects&mdash;by swarms of poor Egyptians, who were not only the
abject tools and slaves of power, but who also ate onions for the
reward of their immortal labours! <a name="citation233"></a><a
href="#footnote233" class="citation">[233]</a>&nbsp; The Pyramids
are quite of this world.</p>
<p>I of course ascended to the summit of the great Pyramid, and
also explored its chambers, but these I need not describe.&nbsp;
The first time that I went to the Pyramids of Ghizeh there were a
number of Arabs hanging about in its neighbourhood, and wanting
to receive presents on various pretences; their Sheik was with
them.&nbsp; There was also present an ill-looking fellow in
soldier&rsquo;s uniform.&nbsp; This man on my departure claimed a
reward, on the ground that he had maintained order and decorum
amongst the Arabs.&nbsp; His claim was not considered valid by my
dragoman, and was rejected accordingly.&nbsp; My <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>donkey-boys
afterwards said they had overheard this fellow propose to the
Sheik to put me to death whilst I was in the interior of the
great Pyramid, and to share with him the booty.&nbsp; Fancy a
struggle for life in one of those burial chambers, with acres and
acres of solid masonry between one&rsquo;s self and the
daylight!&nbsp; I felt exceedingly glad that I had not made the
rascal a present.</p>
<p>I visited the very ancient Pyramids of Aboukir and
Sakkara.&nbsp; There are many of these, and of various shapes and
sizes, and it struck me that, taken together, they might be
considered as showing the progress and perfection (such as it is)
of pyramidical architecture.&nbsp; One of the Pyramids at Sakkara
is almost a rival for the full-grown monster at Ghizeh; others
are scarcely more than vast heaps of brick and stone: these last
suggested to me the idea that after all the Pyramid is nothing
more nor less than a variety of the sepulchral mound so common in
most countries (including, I believe, Hindustan, from whence the
Egyptians are supposed to have come).&nbsp; Men accustomed to
raise these structures for their dead kings or conquerors would
carry the usage with them in their migrations, but arriving in
Egypt, and seeing the impossibility of finding earth sufficiently
tenacious for a mound, they would approximate as nearly as might
be to their ancient custom by raising up a round heap of
stones&mdash;in short, conical pyramids.&nbsp; Of these there are
several at Sakkara, and the materials of some are thrown together
without any order or regularity.&nbsp; The transition from this
simple form to that of the square angular pyramid was easy and
natural, and it seemed to me that the gradations through which
the style passed from infancy up to its mature enormity could
plainly be traced at Sakkara.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE SPHINX</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> near the Pyramids, more
wondrous and more awful than all else in the land of Egypt, there
sits the lonely Sphinx.&nbsp; Comely the creature is, but the
comeliness is not of this world.&nbsp; The once worshipped beast
is a deformity and a monster to this generation; and yet you can
see that those lips, so thick and heavy, were fashioned according
to some ancient mould of beauty&mdash;some mould of beauty now
forgotten&mdash;forgotten because that Greece drew forth Cytherea
from the flashing foam of the &AElig;gean, and in her image
created new forms of beauty, and made it a law among men that the
short and proudly wreathed lip should stand for the sign and the
main condition of loveliness through all generations to
come.&nbsp; Yet still there lives on the race of those who were
beautiful in the fashion of the elder world, and Christian girls
of Coptic blood will look on you with the sad, serious gaze, and
kiss you your charitable hand with the big pouting lips of the
very Sphinx.</p>
<p>Laugh and mock if you will at the worship of stone idols, but
mark ye this, ye breakers of images, that in one regard the stone
idol bears awful semblance of Deity&mdash;unchangefulness in the
midst of change; the same seeming will, and intent for ever, and
ever <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

and Egyptian kings; upon Greek, and Roman; upon Arab and Ottoman
conquerors; upon Napoleon dreaming of an Eastern Empire; upon
battle and pestilence; upon the ceaseless misery of the Egyptian
race; upon keen-eyed travellers&mdash;Herodotus yesterday, and
Warburton <a name="citation236"></a><a href="#footnote236"
class="citation">[236]</a> to-day: upon all and more, this
unworldly Sphinx has watched, and watched like a Providence with
the same earnest eyes, and the same sad, tranquil mien.&nbsp; And
we, we shall die, and Islam will wither away, and the Englishman,
leaning far over to hold his loved India, will plant a firm foot
on the banks of the Nile, and sit in the seats of the Faithful,
and still that sleepless rock will lie watching, and watching the
works of the new, busy race with those same sad, earnest eyes,
and the same tranquil mien everlasting.&nbsp; You dare not mock
at the Sphinx.</p>
<h2><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CAIRO TO SUEZ</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> &ldquo;dromedary&rdquo; of
Egypt and Syria is not the two-humped animal described by that
name in books of natural history, but is, in fact, of the same
family as the camel, to which it stands in about the same
relation as a racer to a cart-horse.&nbsp; The fleetness and
endurance of this creature are extraordinary.&nbsp; It is not
usual to force him into a gallop, and I fancy from his make that
it would be quite impossible for him to maintain that pace for
any length of time; but the animal is on so large a scale, that
the jogtrot at which he is generally ridden implies a progress of
perhaps ten or twelve miles an hour, and this pace, it is said,
he can keep up incessantly, without food, or water, or rest, for
three whole days and nights.</p>
<p>Of the two dromedaries which I had obtained for this journey,
I mounted one myself, and put Dthemetri on the other.&nbsp; My
plan was to ride on with Dthemetri to Suez as rapidly as the
fleetness of the beasts would allow, and to let Mysseri (who was
still weak from the effects of his late illness) come quietly on
with the camels and baggage.</p>
<p>The trot of the dromedary is a pace terribly disagreeeble to
the rider, until he becomes a little <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>accustomed to it; but after the
first half-hour I so far schooled myself to this new exercise,
that I felt capable of keeping it up (though not without aching
limbs) for several hours together.&nbsp; Now, therefore, I was
anxious to dart forward, and annihilate at once the whole space
that divided me from the Red Sea.&nbsp; Dthemetri, however, could
not get on at all.&nbsp; Every attempt which he made to trot
seemed to threaten the utter dislocation of his whole frame, and
indeed I doubt whether anyone of Dthemetri&rsquo;s age (nearly
forty, I think), and unaccustomed to such exercise, could have
borne it at all easily; besides, the dromedary which fell to his
lot was evidently a very bad one; he every now and then came to a
dead stop, and coolly knelt down, as though suggesting that the
rider had better get off at once and abandon the attempt as one
that was utterly hopeless.</p>
<p>When for the third or fourth time I saw Dthemetri thus
planted, I lost my patience, and went on without him.&nbsp; For
about two hours, I think, I advanced without once looking behind
me.&nbsp; I then paused, and cast my eyes back to the western
horizon.&nbsp; There was no sign of Dthemetri, nor of any other
living creature.&nbsp; This I expected, for I knew that I must
have far out-distanced all my followers.&nbsp; I had ridden away
from my party merely by way of gratifying my impatience, and with
the intention of stopping as soon as I felt tired, until I was
overtaken.&nbsp; I now observed, however (this I had not been
able to do whilst advancing so rapidly), that the track which I
had been following was seemingly the track of only one or two
camels.&nbsp; I did not fear that I had diverged very largely
from the true route, but still I could not feel any reasonable
certainty that my party would follow any line of march within
sight of me.</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>I had
to consider, therefore, whether I should remain where I was, upon
the chance of seeing my people come up, or whether I would push
on alone, and find my way to Suez.&nbsp; I had now learned that I
could not rely upon the continued guidance of any track, but I
knew that (if maps were right) the point for which I was bound
bore just due east of Cairo, and I thought that, although I might
miss the line leading most directly to Suez, I could not well
fail to find my way sooner or later to the Red Sea.&nbsp; The
worst of it was that I had no provision of food or water with me,
and already I was beginning to feel thirst.&nbsp; I deliberated
for a minute, and then determined that I would abandon all hope
of seeing my party again in the Desert, and would push forward as
rapidly as possible towards Suez.</p>
<p>It was not, I confess, without a sensation of awe that I swept
with my sight the vacant round of the horizon, and remembered
that I was all alone, and unprovisioned in the midst of the arid
waste; but this very awe gave tone and zest to the exultation
with which I felt myself launched.&nbsp; Hitherto, in all my
wandering, I had been under the care of other
people&mdash;sailors, Tatars, guides, and dragomen had watched
over my welfare, but now at last I was here in this African
desert, and I <i>myself, and no other, had charge of my
life</i>.&nbsp; I liked the office well.&nbsp; I had the greatest
part of the day before me, a very fair dromedary, a fur pelisse,
and a brace of pistols, but no bread and no water; for that I
must ride&mdash;and ride I did.</p>
<p>For several hours I urged forward my beast at a rapid though
steady pace, but now the pangs of thirst began to torment
me.&nbsp; I did not relax my pace, however, and I had not
suffered long when a moving <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>object appeared in the distance
before me.&nbsp; The intervening space was soon traversed, and I
found myself approaching a Bedouin Arab mounted on a camel,
attended by another Bedouin on foot.&nbsp; They stopped.&nbsp; I
saw that, as usual, there hung from the pack-saddle of the camel
a large skin water-flask, which seemed to be well filled.&nbsp; I
steered my dromedary close up alongside of the mounted Bedouin,
caused my beast to kneel down, then alighted, and keeping the end
of the halter in my hand, went up to the mounted Bedouin without
speaking, took hold of his water-flask, opened it, and drank long
and deep from its leathern lips.&nbsp; Both of the Bedouins stood
fast in amazement and mute horror; and really, if they had never
happened to see a European before, the apparition was enough to
startle them.&nbsp; To see for the first time a coat and a
waistcoat with the semblance of a white human head at the top,
and for this ghastly figure to come swiftly out of the horizon
upon a fleet dromedary, approach them silently and with a
demoniacal smile, and drink a deep draught from their
water-flask&mdash;this was enough to make the Bedouins stare a
little; they, in fact, stared a great deal&mdash;not as Europeans
stare, with a restless and puzzled expression of countenance, but
with features all fixed and rigid, and with still, glassy
eyes.&nbsp; Before they had time to get decomposed from their
state of petrifaction I had remounted my dromedary, and was
darting away towards the east.</p>
<p>Without pause or remission of pace I continued to press
forward, but after a while I found to my confusion that the
slight track which had hitherto guided me now failed
altogether.&nbsp; I began to fear that I must have been all along
following the course of some wandering Bedouins, <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>and I felt
that if this were the case, my fate was a little uncertain.</p>
<p>I had no compass with me, but I determined upon the eastern
point of the horizon as accurately as I could by reference to the
sun, and so laid down for myself a way over the pathless
sands.</p>
<p>But now my poor dromedary, by whose life and strength I held
my own, began to show signs of distress; a thick, clammy, and
glutinous kind of foam gathered about her lips, and piteous sobs
burst from her bosom in the tones of human misery.&nbsp; I
doubted for a moment whether I would give her a little rest, a
relaxation of pace, but I decided that I would not, and continued
to push forward as steadily as before.</p>
<p>The character of the country became changed.&nbsp; I had
ridden away from the level tracts, and before me now, and on
either side, there were vast hills of sand and calcined rocks,
that interrupted my progress and baffled my doubtful road, but I
did my best.&nbsp; With rapid steps I swept round the base of the
hills, threaded the winding hollows, and at last, as I rose in my
swift course to the crest of a lofty ridge, Thalatta! Thalatta!
by Jove! I saw the sea!</p>
<p>My tongue can tell where to find a clue to many an old pagan
creed, because that (distinctly from all mere admiration of the
beauty belonging to Nature&rsquo;s works) I acknowledge a sense
of mystical reverence when first I look, to see some illustrious
feature of the globe&mdash;some coastline of ocean, some mighty
river or dreary mountain range, the ancient barrier of
kingdoms.&nbsp; But the Red Sea!&nbsp; It might well claim my
earnest gaze by force of the great Jewish migration which
connects it with the history of our <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>own religion.&nbsp; From this very
ridge, it is likely enough, the panting Israelites first saw that
shining inlet of the sea.&nbsp; Ay! ay! but moreover, and best of
all, that beckoning sea assured my eyes, and proved how well I
had marked out the east for my path, and gave me good promise
that sooner or later the time would come for me to rest and
drink.&nbsp; It was distant, the sea, but I felt my own strength,
and I had <i>heard</i> of the strength of dromedaries.&nbsp; I
pushed forward as eagerly as though I had spoiled the Egyptians
and were flying from Pharaoh&rsquo;s police.</p>
<p>I had not yet been able to discover any symptoms of Suez, but
after a while I descried in the distance a large, blank, isolated
building.&nbsp; I made towards this, and in time got down to
it.&nbsp; The building was a fort, and had been built there for
the protection of a well which it contained within its
precincts.&nbsp; A cluster of small huts adhered to the fort, and
in a short time I was receiving the hospitality of the
inhabitants, who were grouped upon the sands near their
hamlet.&nbsp; To quench the fires of my throat with about a
gallon of muddy water, and to swallow a little of the food placed
before me, was the work of a few minutes, and before the
astonishment of my hosts had even begun to subside, I was
pursuing my onward journey.&nbsp; Suez, I found, was still three
hours distant, and the sun going down in the west warned me that
I must find some other guide to keep me in the right
direction.&nbsp; This guide I found in the most fickle and
uncertain of the elements.&nbsp; For some hours the wind had been
freshening, and it now blew a violent gale; it blew not fitfully
and in squalls, but with such remarkable steadiness that I felt
convinced it would blow from the same quarter for <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>several
hours.&nbsp; When the sun set, therefore, I carefully looked for
the point from which the wind was blowing, and found that it came
from the very west, and was blowing exactly in the direction of
my route.&nbsp; I had nothing to do, therefore, but to go
straight to leeward; and this was not difficult, for the gale
blew with such immense force, that if I diverged at all from its
line I instantly felt the pressure of the blast on the side
towards which I was deviating.&nbsp; Very soon after sunset there
came on complete darkness, but the strong wind guided me well,
and sped me, too, on my way.</p>
<p>I had pushed on for about, I think, a couple of hours after
nightfall, when I saw the glimmer of a light in the distance, and
this I ventured to hope must be Suez.&nbsp; Upon approaching it,
however, I found that it was only a solitary fort, and I passed
on without stopping.</p>
<p>On I went, still riding down the wind, when an unlucky
accident occurred, for which, if you like, you can have your
laugh against me.&nbsp; I have told you already what sort of
lodging it is that you have upon the back of a camel.&nbsp; You
ride the dromedary in the same fashion; you are perched rather
than seated on a bunch of carpets or quilts upon the summit of
the hump.&nbsp; It happened that my dromedary veered rather
suddenly from her onward course.&nbsp; Meeting the movement, I
mechanically turned my left wrist as though I were holding a
bridle-rein, for the complete darkness prevented my eyes from
reminding me that I had nothing but a halter in my hand.&nbsp;
The expected resistance failed, for the halter was hanging upon
that side of the dromedary&rsquo;s neck towards which I was
slightly leaning.&nbsp; I toppled over, head foremost, and then
went falling <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>and falling through air, till my crown came whang
against the ground.&nbsp; And the ground too was perfectly hard
(compacted sand), but the thickly-wadded headgear which I wore
for protection against the sun saved my life.&nbsp; The notion of
my being able to get up again after falling head-foremost from
such an immense height seemed to me at first too paradoxical to
be acted upon, but I soon found that I was not a bit hurt.&nbsp;
My dromedary utterly vanished.&nbsp; I looked round me, and saw
the glimmer of a light in the fort which I had lately passed, and
I began to work my way back in that direction.&nbsp; The violence
of the gale made it hard for me to force my way towards the west,
but I succeeded at last in regaining the fort.&nbsp; To this, as
to the other fort which I had passed, there was attached a
cluster of huts, and I soon found myself surrounded by a group of
villainous, gloomy-looking fellows.&nbsp; It was a horrid bore
for me to have to swagger and look big at a time when I felt so
particularly small on account of my tumble and my lost dromedary;
but there was no help for it, I had no Dthemetri now to
&ldquo;strike terror&rdquo; for me.&nbsp; I knew hardly one word
of Arabic, but somehow or other I contrived to announce it as my
absolute will and pleasure that these fellows should find me the
means of gaining Suez.&nbsp; They acceded, and having a donkey,
they saddled it for me, and appointed one of their number to
attend me on foot.</p>
<p>I afterwards found that these fellows were not Arabs, but
Algerine refugees, and that they bore the character of being sad
scoundrels.&nbsp; They justified this imputation to some extent
on the following day.&nbsp; They allowed Mysseri with my baggage
and the camels to pass unmolested, but an Arab lad <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>belonging
to the party happened to lag a little way in the rear, and him
(if they were not maligned) these rascals stripped and
robbed.&nbsp; Low indeed is the state of bandit morality when men
will allow the sleek traveller with well-laden camels to pass in
quiet, reserving their spirit of enterprise for the tattered
turban of a miserable boy.</p>
<p>I reached Suez at last.&nbsp; The British agent, though roused
from his midnight sleep, received me in his home with the utmost
kindness and hospitality.&nbsp; Oh! by Jove, how delightful it
was to lie on fair sheets, and to dally with sleep, and to wake,
and to sleep, and to wake once more, for the sake of sleeping
again!</p>
<h2><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SUEZ</span></h2>
<p>I was hospitably entertained by the British consul, or agent,
as he is there styled.&nbsp; He is the <i>employ&eacute;</i> of
the East India Company, and not of the Home Government.&nbsp;
Napoleon during his stay of five days at Suez had been the guest
of the consul&rsquo;s father, and I was told that the divan in my
apartment had been the bed of the great commander.</p>
<p>There are two opinions as to the point at which the Israelites
passed the Red Sea.&nbsp; One is, that they traversed only the
very small creek at the northern extremity of the inlet, and that
they entered the bed of the water at the spot on which Suez now
stands; the other, that they crossed the sea from a point
eighteen miles down the coast.&nbsp; The Oxford theologians, who,
with Milman their professor, <a name="citation246"></a><a
href="#footnote246" class="citation">[246]</a> believe that
Jehovah conducted His chosen people without disturbing the order
of nature, adopt the first view, and suppose that the Israelites
passed during an ebb-tide, aided by a violent wind.&nbsp; One
among many objections to this supposition is, that the time of a
single ebb would not have been sufficient for the passage of that
vast multitude of men and beasts, or even for a small fraction of
it.&nbsp; Moreover, the <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>creek to the north of this point can
be compassed in an hour, and in two hours you can make the
circuit of the salt marsh over which the sea may have extended in
former times.&nbsp; If, therefore, the Israelites crossed so high
up as Suez, the Egyptians, unless infatuated by Divine
interference, might easily have recovered their stolen goods from
the encumbered fugitives by making a slight detour.&nbsp; The
opinion which fixes the point of passage at eighteen miles&rsquo;
distance, and from thence right across the ocean depths to the
eastern side of the sea, is supported by the unanimous tradition
of the people, whether Christians or Mussulmans, and is
consistent with Holy Writ: &ldquo;the waters were a wall unto
them on their right hand, <i>and on their left</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Cambridge mathematicians seem to think that the Israelites
were enabled to pass over dry land by adopting a route not
usually subjected to the influx of the sea.&nbsp; This notion is
plausible in a merely hydrostatical point of view, and is
supposed to have been adopted by most of the Fellows of Trinity,
but certainly not by Thorp, who is one of the most amiable of
their number.&nbsp; It is difficult to reconcile this theory with
the account given in Exodus, unless we can suppose that the words
&ldquo;sea&rdquo; and &ldquo;waters&rdquo; are there used in a
sense implying dry land.</p>
<p>Napoleon when at Suez made an attempt to follow the supposed
steps of Moses by passing the creek at this point, but it seems,
according to the testimony of the people at Suez, that he and his
horsemen managed the matter in a way more resembling the failure
of the Egyptians than the success of the Israelites.&nbsp;
According to the French account, Napoleon got out of the
difficulty by that warrior-like presence of mind which served him
so well when <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>the fate of nations depended on the decision of a
moment&mdash;he ordered his horsemen to disperse in all
directions, in order to multiply the chances of finding shallow
water, and was thus enabled to discover a line by which he and
his people were extricated.&nbsp; The story told by the people of
Suez is very different: they declare that Napoleon parted from
his horse, got thoroughly submerged, and was only fished out by
the assistance of the people on shore.</p>
<p>I bathed twice at the point assigned to the passage of the
Israelites, and the second time that I did so I chose the time of
low water and tried to walk across, but I soon found myself out
of my depth, or at least in water so deep that I could only
advance by swimming.</p>
<p>The dromedary, which had bolted in the Desert, was brought
into Suez the day after my arrival, but my pelisse and my
pistols, which had been attached to the saddle, had
disappeared.&nbsp; These articles were treasures of great
importance to me at that time, and I moved the Governor of the
town to make all possible exertions for their recovery.&nbsp; He
acceded to my wishes as well as he could, and very obligingly
imprisoned the first seven poor fellows he could lay his hands
on.</p>
<p>At first the Governor acted in the matter from no other motive
than that of courtesy to an English traveller, but afterwards,
and when he saw the value which I set upon the lost property, he
pushed his measures with a degree of alacrity and heat which
seemed to show that he felt a personal interest in the
matter.&nbsp; It was supposed either that he expected a large
present in the event of succeeding, or that he was striving by
all means to trace the property, in order that he might lay his
hands on it after my departure.</p>
<p>I went out sailing for some hours, and when I <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>returned I
was horrified to find that two men had been bastinadoed by order
of the Governor, with a view to force them to a confession of
their theft.&nbsp; It appeared, however, that there really was
good ground for supposing them guilty, since one of the holsters
was actually found in their possession.&nbsp; It was said, too
(but I could hardly believe it), that whilst one of the men was
undergoing the bastinado, his comrade was overhead encouraging
him to bear the torment without peaching.&nbsp; Both men, if they
had the secret, were resolute in keeping it, and were sent back
to their dungeon.&nbsp; I of course took care that there should
be no repetition of the torture, at least so long as I remained
at Suez.</p>
<p>The Governor was a thorough Oriental, and until a
comparatively recent period had shared in the old Mahometan
feeling of contempt for Europeans.&nbsp; It happened, however,
one day that an English gun-brig had appeared off Suez, and sent
her boats ashore to take in fresh water.&nbsp; Now fresh water at
Suez is a somewhat scarce and precious commodity: it is kept in
tanks, the chief of which is at some distance from the
place.&nbsp; Under these circumstances the request for fresh
water was refused, or, at all events, was not complied
with.&nbsp; The captain of the brig was a simple-minded man with
a strongish will, and he at once declared that if his casks were
not filled in three hours he would destroy the whole place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A great people indeed!&rdquo; said the Governor; &ldquo;a
wonderful people, the English!&rdquo;&nbsp; He instantly caused
every cask to be filled to the brim from his own tank, and ever
afterwards entertained for the English a degree of affection and
respect, for which I felt infinitely indebted to the gallant
captain.</p>
<p><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>The
day after the abortive attempt to extract a confession from the
prisoners, the Governor, the consul, and I sat in council, I know
not how long, with a view of prosecuting the search for the
stolen goods.&nbsp; The sitting, considered in the light of a
criminal investigation, was characteristic of the East.&nbsp; The
proceedings began as a matter of course by the prosecutor&rsquo;s
smoking a pipe and drinking coffee with the Governor, who was
judge, jury, and sheriff.&nbsp; I got on very well with him (this
was not my first interview), and he gave me the pipe from his
lips in testimony of his friendship.&nbsp; I recollect, however,
that my prime adviser, thinking me, I suppose, a great deal too
shy and retiring in my manner, entreated me to put up my boots
and to soil the Governor&rsquo;s divan, in order to inspire
respect and strike terror.&nbsp; I thought it would be as well
for me to retain the right of respecting myself, and that it was
not quite necessary for a well-received guest to strike any
terror at all.</p>
<p>Our deliberations were assisted by the numerous attendants who
lined the three sides of the room not occupied by the
divan.&nbsp; Any one of these who took it into his head to offer
a suggestion would stand forward and humble himself before the
Governor, and then state his views; every man thus giving counsel
was listened to with some attention.</p>
<p>After a great deal of fruitless planning the Governor directed
that the prisoners should be brought in.&nbsp; I was shocked when
they entered, for I was not prepared to see them come
<i>carried</i> into the room upon the shoulders of others.&nbsp;
It had not occurred to me that their battered feet would be too
sore to bear the contact of the floor.&nbsp; They persisted in
asserting their innocence.&nbsp; The Governor wanted to recur <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>to the
torture, but that I prevented, and the men were carried back to
their dungeon.</p>
<p>A scheme was now suggested by one of the attendants which
seemed to me childishly absurd, but it was nevertheless
tried.&nbsp; The plan was to send a man to the prisoners, who was
to make them believe that he had obtained entrance into their
dungeon upon some other pretence, but that he had in reality come
to treat with them for the purchase of the stolen goods.&nbsp;
This shallow expedient of course failed.</p>
<p>The Governor himself had not nominally the power of life and
death over the people in his district, but he could if he chose
send them to Cairo, and have them hanged there.&nbsp; I proposed,
therefore, that the prisoners should be <i>threatened</i> with
this fate.&nbsp; The answer of the Governor made me feel rather
ashamed of my effeminate suggestion.&nbsp; He said that if I
wished it he would willingly threaten them with death, but he
also said that if he threatened <i>he should execute the
threat</i>.</p>
<p>Thinking at last that nothing was to be gained by keeping the
prisoners any longer in confinement, I requested that they might
be set free.&nbsp; To this the Governor acceded, though only, as
he said, out of favour to me, for he had a strong impression that
the men were guilty.&nbsp; I went down to see the prisoners let
out with my own eyes.&nbsp; They were very grateful, and fell
down to the earth, kissing my boots.&nbsp; I gave them a present
to console them for their wounds, and they seemed to be highly
delighted.</p>
<p>Although the matter terminated in a manner so satisfactory to
the principal sufferers, there were symptoms of some angry
excitement in the place: it was said that public opinion was much
shocked at <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>the fact that Mahometans had been beaten on account of
a loss sustained by a Christian.&nbsp; My journey was to
recommence the next day, and it was hinted that if I persevered
in my intention of proceeding, the people would have an easy and
profitable opportunity of wreaking their vengeance on me.&nbsp;
If ever they formed any scheme of the kind, they at all events
refrained from any attempt to carry it into effect.</p>
<p>One of the evenings during my stay at Suez was enlivened by a
triple wedding.&nbsp; There was a long and slow procession.&nbsp;
Some carried torches, and others were thumping drums and firing
pistols.&nbsp; The bridegrooms came last, all walking
abreast.&nbsp; My only reason for mentioning the ceremony (which
was otherwise uninteresting) is, that I scarcely ever in all my
life saw any phenomena so ridiculous as the meekness and gravity
of those three young men whilst being &ldquo;led to the
altar.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SUEZ TO GAZA</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> route over the Desert from Suez
to Gaza is not frequented by merchants, and is seldom passed by a
traveller.&nbsp; This part of the country is less uniformly
barren than the tracts of shifting sand that lie on the El Arish
route.&nbsp; The shrubs on which the camel feeds are more
frequent, and in many spots the sand is mingled with so much of
productive soil as to admit the growth of corn.&nbsp; The
Bedouins are driven out of this district during the summer by the
total want of water, but before the time for their forced
departure arrives they succeed in raising little crops of barley
from these comparatively fertile patches of ground.&nbsp; They
bury the fruit of their labours, leaving marks by which, upon
their return, they may be able to recognise the spot.&nbsp; The
warm, dry sand stands them for a safe granary.&nbsp; The country
at the time I passed it (in the month of April) was pretty
thickly sprinkled with Bedouins expecting their harvest.&nbsp;
Several times my tent was pitched alongside of their
encampments.&nbsp; I have told you already what the impressions
were which these people produced upon my mind.</p>
<p>I saw several creatures of the antelope kind in this part of
the Desert, and one day my Arabs surprised <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>in her
sleep a young gazelle (for so I called her), and took the darling
prisoner.&nbsp; I carried her before me on my camel for the rest
of the day, and kept her in my tent all night.&nbsp; I did all I
could to coax her, but the trembling beauty refused to touch
food, and would not be comforted.&nbsp; Whenever she had a
seeming opportunity of escaping she struggled with a violence so
painfully disproportioned to her fine, delicate limbs, that I
could not continue the cruel attempt to make her my own.&nbsp; In
the morning, therefore, I set her free, anticipating some
pleasure from seeing the joyous bound with which, as I thought,
she would return to her native freedom.&nbsp; She had been so
stupefied, however, by the exciting events of the preceding day
and night, and was so puzzled as to the road she should take,
that she went off very deliberately, and with an uncertain
step.&nbsp; She went away quite sound in limb, but her intellect
may have been upset.&nbsp; Never in all likelihood had she seen
the form of a human being until the dreadful moment when she woke
from her sleep and found herself in the grip of an Arab.&nbsp;
Then her pitching and tossing journey on the back of a camel, and
lastly, a <i>soir&eacute;e</i> with me by candlelight!&nbsp; I
should have been glad to know, if I could, that her heart was not
utterly broken.</p>
<p>My Arabs were somewhat excited one day by discovering the
fresh print of a foot&mdash;the foot, as they said, of a
lion.&nbsp; I had no conception that the lord of the forest
(better known as a crest) ever stalked away from his jungles to
make inglorious war in these smooth plains against antelopes and
gazelles.&nbsp; I supposed that there must have been some error
of interpretation, and that the Arabs meant to speak of a
tiger.&nbsp; It appeared, however, that this was not the <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>case.&nbsp;
Either the Arabs were mistaken, or the noble brute, uncooped and
unchained, had but lately crossed my path.</p>
<p>The camels with which I traversed this part of the Desert were
very different in their ways and habits from those that you get
on a frequented route.&nbsp; They were never led.&nbsp; There was
not the slightest sign of a track in this part of the Desert, but
the camels never failed to choose the right line.&nbsp; By the
direction taken at starting they knew, I suppose, the point (some
encampment) for which they were to make.&nbsp; There is always a
leading camel (generally, I believe, the eldest), who marches
foremost, and determines the path for the whole party.&nbsp; If
it happens that no one of the camels has been accustomed to lead
the others, there is very great difficulty in making a
start.&nbsp; If you force your beast forward for a moment, he
will contrive to wheel and draw back, at the same time looking at
one of the other camels with an expression and gesture exactly
equivalent to <i>apr&egrave;s vous</i>.&nbsp; The responsibility
of finding the way is evidently assumed very unwillingly.&nbsp;
After some time, however, it becomes understood that one of the
beasts has reluctantly consented to take the lead, and he
accordingly advances for that purpose.&nbsp; For a minute or two
he goes on with much indecision, taking first one line and then
another, but soon by the aid of some mysterious sense he
discovers the true direction, and follows it steadily from
morning to night.&nbsp; When once the leadership is established,
you cannot by any persuasion, and can scarcely by any force,
induce a junior camel to walk one single step in advance of the
chosen guide.</p>
<p>On the fifth day I came to an oasis, called the Wady el Arish,
a ravine, or rather a gully, through <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>which during a part of the year
there runs a stream of water.&nbsp; On the sides of the gully
there were a number of those graceful trees which the Arabs call
<i>tarfa</i>.&nbsp; The channel of the stream was quite dry in
the part at which we arrived, but at about half a mile off some
water was found, which, though very muddy, was tolerably
sweet.&nbsp; This was a happy discovery, for all the water that
we had brought from the neighbourhood of Suez was rapidly
putrefying.</p>
<p>The want of foresight is an anomalous part of the
Bedouin&rsquo;s character, for it does not result either from
recklessness or stupidity.&nbsp; I know of no human being whose
body is so thoroughly the slave of mind as that of the
Arab.&nbsp; His mental anxieties seem to be for ever torturing
every nerve and fibre of his body, and yet with all this
exquisite sensitiveness to the suggestions of the mind, he is
grossly improvident.&nbsp; I recollect, for instance, that when
setting out upon this passage of the Desert, my Arabs, in order
to lighten the burthen of their camels, were most anxious that we
should take with us only two days&rsquo; supply of water.&nbsp;
They said that by the time that supply was exhausted we should
arrive at a spring which would furnish us for the rest of the
journey.&nbsp; My servants very wisely, and with much
pertinacity, resisted the adoption of this plan, and took care to
have both the large skins well filled.&nbsp; We proceeded, and
found no water at all, either at the expected spring or for many
days afterwards, so that nothing but the precaution of my own
people saved us from the very severe suffering which we should
have endured if we had entered upon the Desert with only a two
days&rsquo; supply.&nbsp; The Arabs themselves being on foot
would have suffered much more than I from the consequences of
their improvidence.</p>
<p><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>This
unaccountable want of foresight prevents the Bedouin from
appreciating at a distance of eight or ten days the amount of the
misery which he entails upon himself at the end of that
period.&nbsp; His dread of a city is one of the most painful
mental affections that I have ever observed, and yet when the
whole breadth of the Desert lies between him and the town to
which you are going, he will freely enter into an agreement to
<i>land</i> you in the city for which you are bound.&nbsp; When,
however, after many a day of toil the distant minarets at length
appear, the poor Bedouin relaxes the vigour of his pace, his
steps become faltering and undecided, every moment his uneasiness
increases, and at length he fairly sobs aloud, and embracing your
knees, implores with the most piteous cries and gestures that you
will dispense with him and his camels, and find some other means
of entering the city.&nbsp; This, of course, one can&rsquo;t
agree to, and the consequence is that one is obliged to witness
and resist the most moving expressions of grief and fond
entreaty.&nbsp; I had to go through a most painful scene of this
kind when I entered Cairo, and now the horror which these wilder
Arabs felt at the notion of entering Gaza led to consequences
still more distressing.&nbsp; The dread of cities results partly
from a kind of wild instinct which has always characterised the
descendants of Ishmael, but partly too from a well-founded
apprehension of ill-treatment.&nbsp; So often it happens that the
poor Bedouin, when once jammed in between walls, is seized by the
Government authorities for the sake of his camels, that his
innate horror of cities becomes really justified by results.</p>
<p>The Bedouins with whom I performed this journey were wild
fellows of the Desert, quite unaccustomed to let out themselves
or their beasts for hire, and when <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>they found that by the natural
ascendency of Europeans they were gradually brought down to a
state of subserviency to me, or rather to my attendants, they
bitterly repented, I believe, of having placed themselves under
our control.&nbsp; They were rather difficult fellows to manage,
and gave Dthemetri a good deal of trouble, but I liked them all
the better for that.</p>
<p>Selim, the chief of the party, and the man to whom all our
camels belonged, was a fine, savage, stately fellow.&nbsp; There
were, I think, five other Arabs of the party, but when we
approached the end of the journey they one by one began to make
off towards the neighbouring encampments, and by the time that
the minarets of Gaza were in sight, Selim, the owner of the
camels, was the only one who remained.&nbsp; He, poor fellow, as
we neared the town began to discover the same terrors that my
Arabs had shown when I entered Cairo.&nbsp; I could not possibly
accede to his entreaties and consent to let my baggage be laid
down on the bare sands, without any means of having it brought on
into the city.&nbsp; So at length, when poor Selim had exhausted
all his rhetoric of voice and action and tears, he fixed his
despairing eyes for a minute upon the cherished beasts that were
his only wealth, and then suddenly and madly dashed away into the
farther Desert.&nbsp; I continued my course and reached the city
at last, but it was not without immense difficulty that we could
constrain the poor camels to pass under the hated shadow of its
walls.&nbsp; They were the genuine beasts of the Desert, and it
was sad and painful to witness the agony they suffered when thus
they were forced to encounter the fixed habitations of men.&nbsp;
They shrank from the beginning of every high, narrow <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>street as
though from the entrance of some horrible cave or bottomless pit;
they sighed and wept like women.&nbsp; When at last we got them
within the courtyard of the khan they seemed to be quite
broken-hearted, and looked round piteously for their loving
master; but no Selim came.&nbsp; I had imagined that he would
enter the town secretly by night in order to carry off those five
fine camels, his only wealth in this world, and seemingly the
main objects of his affection.&nbsp; But no; his dread of
civilisation was too strong.&nbsp; During the whole of the three
days that I remained at Gaza he failed to show himself, and thus
sacrificed in all probability not only his camels, but the money
which I had stipulated to pay him for the passage of the
Desert.&nbsp; In order, however, to do all I could towards saving
him from this last misfortune I resorted to a contrivance
frequently adopted by the Asiatics: I assembled a group of grave
and worthy Mussulmans in the courtyard of the khan, and in their
presence paid over the gold to a Sheik who was accustomed to
communicate with the Arabs of the Desert.&nbsp; All present
solemnly promised that if ever Selim should come to claim his
rights, they would bear true witness in his favour.</p>
<p>I saw a great deal of my old friend the Governor of
Gaza.&nbsp; He had received orders to send back all persons
coming from Egypt, and force them to perform quarantine at El
Arish.&nbsp; He knew so little of quarantine regulations,
however, that his dress was actually in contact with mine whilst
he insisted upon the stringency of the orders which he had
received.&nbsp; He was induced to make an exception in my favour,
and I rewarded him with a musical snuff-box which I had bought at
Smyrna for the purpose of presenting it to any man in authority
who might happen to <a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>do me an important service.&nbsp;
The Governor was delighted with his toy, and took it off to his
harem with great exultation.&nbsp; He soon, however, returned
with an altered countenance; his wives, he said, had got hold of
the box and put it out of order.&nbsp; So shortlived is human
happiness in this frail world!</p>
<p>The Governor fancied that he should incur less risk if I
remained at Gaza for two or three days more, and he wanted me to
become his guest.&nbsp; I persuaded him, however, that it would
be better for him to let me depart at once.&nbsp; He wanted to
add to my baggage a roast lamb and a quantity of other cumbrous
viands, but I escaped with half a horse-load of leaven bread,
which was very good of its kind, and proved a most useful
present.&nbsp; The air with which the Governor&rsquo;s slaves
affected to be almost breaking down under the weight of the gifts
which they bore on their shoulders, reminded me of the figures
one sees in some of the old pictures.</p>
<h2><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">GAZA TO NABLUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Passing</span> now once again through
Palestine and Syria I retained the tent which I had used in the
Desert, and found that it added very much to my comfort in
travelling.&nbsp; Instead of turning out a family from some
wretched dwelling, and depriving them of a repose which I was
sure not to find for myself, I now, when evening came, pitched my
tent upon some smiling spot within a few hundred yards of the
village to which I looked for my supplies, that is, for milk and
bread if I had it not with me, and sometimes also for eggs.&nbsp;
The worst of it is, that the needful viands are not to be
obtained by coin, but only by intimidation.&nbsp; I at first
tried the usual agent, money.&nbsp; Dthemetri, with one or two of
my Arabs, went into the village near which I was encamped and
tried to buy the required provisions, offering liberal payment,
but he came back empty-handed.&nbsp; I sent him again, but this
time he held different language.&nbsp; He required to see the
elders of the place, and threatening dreadful vengeance, directed
them upon their responsibility to take care that my tent should
be immediately and abundantly supplied.&nbsp; He was obeyed at
once, and the provisions refused to me as a purchaser soon
arrived, trebled or quadrupled, when <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>demanded by way of a forced
contribution.&nbsp; I quickly found (I think it required two
experiments to convince me) that this peremptory method was the
only one which could be adopted with success.&nbsp; It never
failed.&nbsp; Of course, however, when the provisions have been
actually obtained you can, if you choose, give money exceeding
the value of the provisions to somebody.&nbsp; An English, a
thoroughbred English, traveller will always do this (though it is
contrary to the custom of the country) for the quiet (false quiet
though it be) of his own conscience, but so to order the matter
that the poor fellows who have been forced to contribute should
be the persons to receive the value of their supplies, is not
possible.&nbsp; For a traveller to attempt anything so grossly
just as that would be too outrageous.&nbsp; The truth is, that
the usage of the East, in old times, required the people of the
village, at their own cost, to supply the wants of travellers,
and the ancient custom is now adhered to, not in favour of
travellers generally, but in favour of those who are deemed
sufficiently powerful to enforce its observance.&nbsp; If the
villagers therefore find a man waiving this right to oppress
them, and offering coin for that which he is entitled to take
without payment, they suppose at once that he is actuated by fear
(fear of <i>them</i>, poor fellows!), and it is so delightful to
them to act upon this flattering assumption, that they will
forego the advantage of a good price for their provisions rather
than the rare luxury of refusing for once in their lives to part
with their own possessions.</p>
<p>The practice of intimidation thus rendered necessary is
utterly hateful to an Englishman.&nbsp; He finds himself forced
to conquer his daily bread by the pompous threats of the
dragoman, his very subsistence, as well <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>as his
dignity and personal safety, being made to depend upon his
servant&rsquo;s assuming a tone of authority which does not at
all belong to him.&nbsp; Besides, he can scarcely fail to see
that as he passes through the country he becomes the innocent
cause of much extra injustice, many supernumerary wrongs.&nbsp;
This he feels to be especially the case when he travels with
relays.&nbsp; To be the owner of a horse or a mule within reach
of an Asiatic potentate, is to lead the life of the hare and the
rabbit, hunted down and ferreted out.&nbsp; Too often it happens
that the works of the field are stopped in the daytime, that the
inmates of the cottage are roused from their midnight sleep by
the sudden coming of a Government officer, and the poor
husbandman, driven by threats and rewarded by curses, if he would
not lose sight for ever of his captured beasts, must quit all and
follow them.&nbsp; This is done that the Englishman may
travel.&nbsp; He would make his way more harmless if he could,
but horses or mules he <i>must</i> have, and these are his ways
and means.</p>
<p>The town of Nablus is beautiful; it lies in a valley hemmed in
with olive groves, and its buildings are interspersed with
frequent palm-trees.&nbsp; It is said to occupy the site of the
ancient Sychem.&nbsp; I know not whether it was there indeed that
the father of the Jews was accustomed to feed his flocks, but the
valley is green and smiling, and is held at this day by a race
more brave and beautiful than Jacob&rsquo;s unhappy
descendants.</p>
<p>Nablus is the very furnace of Mahometan bigotry; <a
name="citation263"></a><a href="#footnote263"
class="citation">[263]</a> and I believe that only a few months
before the time of my going there it would have been quite unsafe
for a man, unless strongly guarded, to show himself to the people
of the town in a Frank costume; but <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>since their last insurrection the
Mahometans of the place had been so far subdued by the severity
of Ibrahim Pasha, that they dared not now offer the slightest
insult to a European.&nbsp; It was quite plain, however, that the
effort with which the men of the old school refrained from
expressing their opinion of a hat and a coat was horribly painful
to them.&nbsp; As I walked through the streets and bazaars a dead
silence prevailed; every man suspended his employment, and gazed
on me with a fixed, glassy look, which seemed to say, &ldquo;God
is good, but how marvellous and inscrutable are His ways that
thus He permits this white-faced dog of a Christian to hunt
through the paths of the faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The insurrection of these people had been more formidable than
any other that Ibrahim Pasha had to contend with.&nbsp; He was
only able to crush them at last by the assistance of a fellow
renowned for his resources in the way of stratagem and cunning,
as well as for his knowledge of the country.&nbsp; This personage
was no other than Aboo Goosh (&ldquo;the father of lies&rdquo;),
<a name="citation264"></a><a href="#footnote264"
class="citation">[264]</a> who was taken out of prison for the
purpose.&nbsp; The &ldquo;father of lies&rdquo; enabled Ibrahim
to hem in the insurrection and extinguish it.&nbsp; He was
rewarded with the Governorship of Jerusalem, which he held when I
was there.&nbsp; I recollect, by the by, that he tried one of his
stratagems upon me.&nbsp; I did not go to see him, as I ought in
courtesy to have done, during my stay at Jerusalem; but I
happened to be the owner of a rather handsome <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>amber
<i>tchibouque</i> piece, which the Governor heard of, and by some
means contrived to see.&nbsp; He sent to me, and dressed up a
statement that he would give me a price immensely exceeding the
sum which I had given for it.&nbsp; He did not add my
<i>tchibouque</i> to the rest of his trophies.</p>
<p>There was a small number of Greek Christians resident in
Nablus, and over these the Mussulmans held a high hand, not even
permitting them to speak to each other in the open streets; but
if the Moslems thus set themselves above the poor Christians of
the place, I, or rather my servants, soon took the ascendant over
<i>them</i>.&nbsp; I recollect that just as we were starting from
the place, and at a time when a number of people had gathered
together in the main street to see our preparations, Mysseri,
being provoked at some piece of perverseness on the part of a
true believer, coolly thrashed him with his horsewhip before the
assembled crowd of fanatics.&nbsp; I was much annoyed at the
time, for I thought that the people would probably rise against
us.&nbsp; They turned rather pale, but stood still.</p>
<p>The day of my arrival at Nablus was a f&ecirc;te&mdash;the
new-year&rsquo;s day of the Mussulmans.&nbsp; <a
name="citation265a"></a><a href="#footnote265a"
class="citation">[265a]</a> <a name="citation265b"></a><a
href="#footnote265b" class="citation">[265b]</a>&nbsp; Most of
the <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>people were amusing themselves in the beautiful lawns
and shady groves without the city.&nbsp; The men (except myself)
were all remotely apart from the other sex.&nbsp; The women in
groups were diverting themselves and their children with
swings.&nbsp; They were so handsome, that they could not keep up
their yashmaks.&nbsp; I believe that they had never before looked
upon a man in the European dress, and when they now saw in me
that strange phenomenon, and saw, too, how they could please the
creature by showing him a glimpse of beauty, they seemed to think
it was better fun to do this than to go on playing with
swings.&nbsp; It was always, however, with a sort of zoological
expression of countenance that they looked on the horrible
monster from Europe, and whenever one of them gave me to see for
one sweet instant the blushing of her unveiled face, it was with
the same kind of air as that with which a young, timid girl will
edge her way up to an elephant and tremblingly give him a nut
from the tips of her rosy fingers.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">MARIAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no spirit of propagandism
in the Mussulmans of the Ottoman dominions.&nbsp; True it is that
a prisoner of war, or a Christian condemned <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>to death,
may on some occasions save his life by adopting the religion of
Mahomet, but instances of this kind are now exceedingly rare, and
are quite at variance with the general system.&nbsp; Many
Europeans, I think, would be surprised to learn that which is
nevertheless quite true, namely, that an attempt to disturb the
religious repose of the empire by the conversion of a Christian
to the Mahometan faith is positively illegal.&nbsp; The event
which now I am going to mention shows plainly enough that the
unlawfulness of such interference is distinctly recognised even
in the most bigoted stronghold of Islam.</p>
<p>During my stay at Nablus I took up my quarters at the house of
the Greek &ldquo;papa&rdquo; as he is called, that is, the Greek
priest.&nbsp; The priest himself had gone to Jerusalem upon the
business I am going to tell you of, but his wife remained at
Nablus, and did the honours of her home.</p>
<p>Soon after my arrival a deputation from the Greek Christians
of the place came to request my interference in a matter which
had occasioned vast excitement.</p>
<p>And now I must tell you how it came to happen, as it did
continually, that people thought it worth while to claim the
assistance of a mere traveller, who was totally devoid of all
just pretensions to authority or influence of even the humblest
description, and especially I must explain to you how it was that
the power thus attributed did really belong to me, or rather to
my dragoman.&nbsp; Successive political convulsions had at length
fairly loosed the people of Syria from their former rules of
conduct, and from all their old habits of reliance.&nbsp; The
violence and success with which Mehemet Ali <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>crushed the
insurrection of the Mahometan population had utterly beaten down
the head of Islam, and extinguished, for the time at least, those
virtues and vices which had sprung from the Mahometan
faith.&nbsp; Success so complete as Mehemet Ali&rsquo;s, if it
had been attained by an ordinary Asiatic potentate, would have
induced a notion of stability.&nbsp; The readily bowing mind of
the Oriental would have bowed low and long under the feet of a
conqueror whom God had thus strengthened.&nbsp; But Syria was no
field for contests strictly Asiatic.&nbsp; Europe was involved,
and though the heavy masses of Egyptian troops, clinging with
strong grip to the land, might seem to hold it fast, yet every
peasant practically felt, and knew, that in Vienna or Petersburg
or London there were four or five pale-looking men who could pull
down the star of the Pasha with shreds of paper and ink.&nbsp;
The people of the country knew, too, that Mehemet Ali was strong
with the strength of the Europeans&mdash;strong by his French
general, his French tactics, and his English engines.&nbsp;
Moreover, they saw that the person, the property, and even the
dignity of the humblest European was guarded with the most
careful solicitude.&nbsp; The consequence of all this was, that
the people of Syria looked vaguely, but confidently, to Europe
for fresh changes.&nbsp; Many would fix upon some nation, France
or England, and steadfastly regard it as the arriving sovereign
of Syria.&nbsp; Those whose minds remained in doubt equally
contributed to this new state of public opinion, which no longer
depended upon religion and ancient habits, but upon bare hopes
and fears.&nbsp; Every man wanted to know, not who was his
neighbour, but who was to be his ruler; whose feet he was to
kiss, and by whom <i>his</i> feet <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>were to be ultimately beaten.&nbsp;
Treat your friend, says the proverb, as though he were one day to
become your enemy, and your enemy as though he were one day to
become your friend.&nbsp; The Syrians went further, and seemed
inclined to treat every stranger as though he might one day
become their Pasha.&nbsp; Such was the state of circumstances and
of feeling which now for the first time had thoroughly opened the
mind of Western Asia for the reception of Europeans and European
ideas.&nbsp; The credit of the English especially was so great,
that a good Mussulman flying from the conscription, or any other
persecution, would come to seek from the formerly despised hat
that protection which the turban could no longer afford; and a
man high in authority (as, for instance, the Governor in command
of Gaza) would think that he had won a prize, or, at all events,
a valuable lottery ticket, if he obtained a written approval of
his conduct from a simple traveller.</p>
<p>Still, in order that any immediate result should follow from
all this unwonted readiness in the Asiatic to succumb to the
European, it was necessary that someone should be at hand who
could see and would push the advantage.&nbsp; I myself had
neither the inclination nor the power to do so, but it happened
that Dthemetri, who, as my dragoman, represented me on all
occasions, was the very person of all others best fitted to avail
himself with success of this yielding tendency in the Oriental
mind.&nbsp; If the chance of birth and fortune had made poor
Dthemetri a tailor during some part of his life, yet religion and
the literature of the Church which he served had made him a man,
and a brave man too.&nbsp; The lives of saints with which he was
familiar were full of heroic <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>actions provoking imitation, and
since faith in a creed involves a faith in its ultimate triumph,
Dthemetri was bold from a sense of true strength.&nbsp; His
education too, though not very general in its character, had been
carried quite far enough to justify him in pluming himself upon a
very decided advantage over the great bulk of the Mahometan
population, including the men in authority.&nbsp; With all this
consciousness of religious and intellectual superiority Dthemetri
had lived for the most part in countries lying under Mussulman
governments, and had witnessed (perhaps too had suffered from)
their revolting cruelties; the result was that he abhorred and
despised the Mahometan faith and all who clung to it.&nbsp; And
this hate was not of the dry, dull, and inactive sort.&nbsp;
Dthemetri was in his sphere a true Crusader, and whenever there
appeared a fair opening in the defences of Islam, he was ready
and eager to make the assault.&nbsp; These sentiments, backed by
a consciousness of understanding the people with whom he had to
do, made Dthemetri not only firm and resolute in his constant
interviews with men in authority, but sometimes also (as you may
know already) very violent and even insulting.&nbsp; This tone,
which I always disliked, though I was fain to profit by it,
invariably succeeded.&nbsp; It swept away all resistance; there
was nothing in the then depressed and succumbing mind of the
Mussulman that could oppose a zeal so warm and fierce.</p>
<p>As for me, I of course stood aloof from Dthemetri&rsquo;s
crusades, and did not even render him any active assistance when
he was striving (as he almost always was, poor fellow) on my
behalf; I was only the death&rsquo;s head and white sheet with
which he scared the enemy.&nbsp; I think, however, that I played
this spectral part exceedingly well, for I seldom appeared <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>at all in
any discussion, and whenever I did, I was sure to be white and
calm.</p>
<p>The event which induced the Christians of Nablus to seek for
my assistance was this.&nbsp; A beautiful young Christian,
between fifteen and sixteen years old, had lately been married to
a man of her own creed.&nbsp; About the same time (probably on
the occasion of her wedding) she was accidently seen by a
Mussulman Sheik of great wealth and local influence, who
instantly became madly enamoured of her.&nbsp; The strict
morality which so generally prevails where the Mussulmans have
complete ascendency prevented the Sheik from entertaining any
such sinful hopes as a European might have ventured to cherish
under the like circumstances, and he saw no chance of gratifying
his love except by inducing the girl to embrace his own
creed.&nbsp; If he could induce her to take this step, her
marriage with the Christian would be dissolved, and then there
would be nothing to prevent him from making her the last and
brightest of his wives.&nbsp; The Sheik was a practical man, and
quickly began his attack upon the theological opinions of the
bride.&nbsp; He did not assail her with the eloquence of any
imaums or Mussulman saints; he did not press upon her the eternal
truths of the &ldquo;Cow,&rdquo; <a name="citation272"></a><a
href="#footnote272" class="citation">[272]</a> or the beautiful
morality of &ldquo;the Table&rdquo;; <a name="citation272"></a><a
href="#footnote272" class="citation">[272]</a> he sent her no
tracts, not even a copy of the holy Koran.&nbsp; An old woman
acted as missionary.&nbsp; She brought with her a whole basketful
of arguments&mdash;jewels and shawls and scarfs, and all kinds of
persuasive finery.&nbsp; Poor Mariam! she put on the jewels and
took a calm view of the Mahometan religion in a little
hand-mirror; she could not be <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>deaf to such eloquent earrings, and
the great truths of Islam came home to her young bosom in the
delicate folds of the cashmere; she was ready to abandon her
faith.</p>
<p>The Sheik knew very well that his attempt to convert an
infidel was illegal, and that his proceedings would not bear
investigation, so he took care to pay a large sum to the Governor
of Nablus in order to obtain his connivance.</p>
<p>At length Mariam quitted her home and placed herself under the
protection of the Mahometan authorities, who, however, refrained
from delivering her into the arms of her lover, and detained her
in a mosque until the fact of her real conversion (which had been
indignantly denied by her relatives) should be established.&nbsp;
For two or three days the mother of the young convert was
prevented from communicating with her child by various evasive
contrivances, but not, it would seem, by a flat refusal.&nbsp; At
length it was announced that the young lady&rsquo;s profession of
faith might be heard from her own lips.&nbsp; At an hour
appointed the friends of the Sheik and the relatives of the
damsel met in the mosque.&nbsp; The young convert addressed her
mother in a loud voice, and said, &ldquo;God is God, and Mahomet
is the Prophet of God, and thou, oh my mother, art an infidel,
feminine dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You would suppose that this declaration, so clearly enounced,
and that, too, in a place where Mahometanism is perhaps more
supreme than in any other part of the empire, would have sufficed
to have confirmed the pretensions of the lover.&nbsp; This,
however, was not the case.&nbsp; The Greek priest of the place
was despatched on a mission to the Governor of Jerusalem (Aboo
Goosh), in order to complain <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>against the proceedings of the Sheik
and obtain a restitution of the bride.&nbsp; Meanwhile the
Mahometan authorities at Nablus were so conscious of having acted
unlawfully in conspiring to disturb the faith of the beautiful
infidel, that they hesitated to take any further steps, and the
girl was still detained in the mosque.</p>
<p>Thus matters stood when the Christians of the place came and
sought to obtain my assistance.</p>
<p>I felt (with regret) that I had no personal interest in the
matter, and I also thought that there was no pretence for my
interfering with the conflicting claims of the Christian husband
and the Mahometan lover, and I therefore declined to take any
step.</p>
<p>My speaking of the husband, by the bye, reminds me that he was
extremely backward about the great work of recovering his
youthful bride.&nbsp; The relations of the girl, who felt
themselves disgraced by her conduct, were vehement and excited to
a high pitch, but the Menelaus of Nablus was exceedingly calm and
composed.</p>
<p>The fact that it was not technically my duty to interfere in a
matter of this kind was a very sufficient, and yet a very
unsatisfactory, reason for my refusal of all assistance.&nbsp;
Until you are placed in situations of this kind you can hardly
tell how painful it is to refrain from intermeddling in other
people&rsquo;s affairs&mdash;to refrain from intermeddling when
you feel that you can do so with happy effect, and can remove a
load of distress by the use of a few small phrases.&nbsp; Upon
this occasion, however, an expression fell from one of the
girl&rsquo;s kinsmen which not only determined me against the
idea of interfering, but made me hope that all attempts to
recover the proselyte would fail.&nbsp; This person, speaking
with the most savage bitterness, <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>and with the cordial approval of all
the other relatives, said that the girl ought to be beaten to
death.&nbsp; I could not fail to see that if the poor child were
ever restored to her family she would be treated with the most
frightful barbarity.&nbsp; I heartily wished, therefore, that the
Mussulmans might be firm, and preserve their young prize from any
fate so dreadful as that of a return to her own relations.</p>
<p>The next day the Greek priest returned from his mission to
Aboo Goosh, but the &ldquo;father of lies,&rdquo; it would seem,
had been well plied with the gold of the enamoured Sheik, and
contrived to put off the prayers of the Christians by cunning
feints.&nbsp; Now, therefore, a second and more numerous
deputation than the first waited upon me, and implored my
intervention with the Governor.&nbsp; I informed the assembled
Christians that since their last application I had carefully
considered the matter.&nbsp; The religious question I thought
might be put aside at once, for the excessive levity which the
girl had displayed proved clearly that in adopting Mahometanism
she was not quitting any other faith.&nbsp; Her mind must have
been thoroughly blank upon religious questions, and she was not,
therefore, to be treated as a Christian that had strayed from the
flock, but rather as a child without any religion at all, who was
willing to conform to the usages of those who would deck her with
jewels, and clothe her with cashmere shawls.</p>
<p>So much for the religious part of the question.&nbsp; Well,
then, in a mere temporal sense, it appeared to me that (looking
merely to the interests of the damsel, for I rather unjustly put
poor Menelaus quite out of the question) the advantages were all
on the <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>side of the Mahometan match.&nbsp; The Sheik was in a
much higher station of life than the superseded husband, and had
given the best possible proof of his ardent affection by the
sacrifices he had made, and the risks he had incurred, for the
sake of the beloved object.&nbsp; I therefore stated fairly, to
the horror and amazement of all my hearers, that the Sheik, in my
view, was likely to make a most capital husband, and that I
entirely &ldquo;approved of the match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left Nablus under the impression that Mariam would soon be
delivered to her Mussulman lover.&nbsp; I afterwards found,
however, that the result was very different.&nbsp;
Dthemetri&rsquo;s religious zeal and hate had been so much
excited by the account of these events, and by the grief and
mortification of his co-religionists, that when he found me
firmly determined to decline all interference in the matter, he
secretly appealed to the Governor in my name, and (using, I
suppose, many violent threats, and telling no doubt many lies
about my station and influence) extorted a promise that the
proselyte should be restored to her relatives.&nbsp; I did not
understand that the girl had been actually given up whilst I
remained at Nablus, but Dthemetri certainly did not desist from
his instances until he had satisfied himself by some means or
other (for mere words amounted to nothing) that the promise would
be actually performed.&nbsp; It was not till I had quitted Syria,
and when Dthemetri was no longer in my service, that this
villainous, though well-motived trick, of his came to my
knowledge.&nbsp; Mysseri, who had informed me of the step which
had been taken, did not know it himself until some time after we
had quitted Nablus, when Dthemetri exultingly confessed his
successful enterprise.&nbsp; I know not whether the <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>engagement
which my zealous dragoman extorted from the Governor was ever
complied with.&nbsp; I shudder to think of the fate which must
have befallen Mariam if she fell into the hands of the
Christians.</p>
<h2><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PROPHET DAMOOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some hours I passed along the
shores of the fair lake of Galilee; then turning a little to the
westward, I struck into a mountainous tract, and as I advanced
thenceforward, the lie of the country kept growing more and more
bold.&nbsp; At length I drew near to the city of Safed.&nbsp; It
sits as proud as a fortress upon the summit of a craggy height;
yet because of its minarets and stately trees, the place looks
happy and beautiful.&nbsp; It is one of the holy cities of the
Talmud, and according to this authority, the Messiah will reign
there for forty years before He takes possession of Sion.&nbsp;
The sanctity and historical importance thus attributed to the
city by anticipation render it a favourite place of retirement
for Israelites, of whom it contains, they say, about four
thousand, a number nearly balancing that of the Mahometan
inhabitants.&nbsp; I knew by my experience of Tabarieh that a
&ldquo;holy city&rdquo; was sure to have a population of vermin
somewhat proportionate to the number of its Israelites, and I
therefore caused my tent to be pitched upon a green spot of
ground at a respectful distance from the walls of the town.</p>
<p>When it had become quite dark (for there was no moon that
night) I was informed that several Jews <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>had
secretly come from the city in the hope of obtaining some
assistance from me in circumstances of imminent danger; I was
also informed that they claimed my aid upon the ground that some
of their number were British subjects.&nbsp; It was arranged that
the two principal men of the party should speak for the rest, and
these were accordingly admitted into my tent.&nbsp; One of the
two called himself the British vice-consul, and he had with him
his consular cap, but he frankly said that he could not have
dared to assume this emblem of his dignity in the daytime, and
that nothing but the extreme darkness of the night rendered it
safe for him to put it on upon this occasion.&nbsp; The other of
the spokesmen was a Jew of Gibraltar, a tolerably well-bred
person, who spoke English very fluently.</p>
<p>These men informed me that the Jews of the place, who were
exceedingly wealthy, had lived peaceably in their retirement
until the insurrection which took place in 1834, but about the
beginning of that year a highly religious Mussulman called
Mohammed Damoor went forth into the market-place, crying with a
loud voice, and prophesying that on the fifteenth of the
following June the true Believers would rise up in just wrath
against the Jews, and despoil them of their gold and their silver
and their jewels.&nbsp; The earnestness of the prophet produced
some impression at the time, but all went on as usual, until at
last the fifteenth of June arrived.&nbsp; When that day dawned
the whole Mussulman population of the place assembled in the
streets that they might see the result of the prophecy.&nbsp;
Suddenly Mohammed Damoor rushed furious into the crowd, and the
fierce shout of the prophet soon ensured the fulfilment of his
prophecy.&nbsp; Some of the Jews fled, <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>and some
remained, but they who fled and they who remained, alike, and
unresistingly, left their property to the hands of the
spoilers.&nbsp; The most odious of all outrages, that of
searching the women for the base purpose of discovering such
things as gold and silver concealed about their persons, was
perpetrated without shame.&nbsp; The poor Jews were so stricken
with terror, that they submitted to their fate even where
resistance would have been easy.&nbsp; In several instances a
young Mussulman boy, not more than ten or twelve years of age,
walked straight into the house of a Jew and stripped him of his
property before his face, and in the presence of his whole
family. <a name="citation280"></a><a href="#footnote280"
class="citation">[280]</a>&nbsp; When the insurrection was put
down some of the Mussulmans (most probably those who had got no
spoil wherewith they might buy immunity) were punished, but the
greater part of them escaped.&nbsp; None of the booty was
restored, and the pecuniary redress which the Pasha had
undertaken to enforce for them had been hitherto so carefully
delayed, that the hope of ever obtaining it had grown very
faint.&nbsp; A new Governor had been appointed to the command of
the place, with stringent orders to ascertain the real extent of
the losses, and to discover the spoilers, with a view of
compelling them to make restitution.&nbsp; It was found that,
notwithstanding the urgency of the instructions which the
Governor had received, he did not push on the affair with the
vigour that had been expected.&nbsp; The Jews complained, and
either by the protection of the British consul at Damascus, or by
some other means, had influence enough to induce the appointment
of a special commissioner&mdash;they called him &ldquo;the
Modeer&rdquo;&mdash;whose duty it was to watch <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>for and
prevent anything like connivance on the part of the Governor, and
to push on the investigation with vigour and impartiality.</p>
<p>Such were the instructions with which some few weeks since the
Modeer came charged.&nbsp; The result was that the investigation
had made no practical advance, and that the Modeer as well as the
Governor was living upon terms of affectionate friendship with
Mohammed Damoor and the rest of the principal spoilers.</p>
<p>Thus stood the chance of redress for the past, but the cause
of the agonising excitement under which the Jews of the place now
laboured was recent and justly alarming.&nbsp; Mohammed Damoor
had again gone forth into the market-place, and lifted up his
voice and prophesied a second spoliation of the Israelites.&nbsp;
This was grave matter; the words of such a practical man as
Mohammed Damoor were not to be despised.&nbsp; I fear I must have
smiled visibly, for I was greatly amused, and even, I think,
gratified at the account of this second prophecy.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, my heart warmed towards the poor oppressed
Israelites, and I was flattered, too, in the point of my national
vanity at the notion of the far-reaching link by which a Jew in
Syria, who had been born on the rock of Gibraltar, was able to
claim me as his fellow-countryman.&nbsp; If I hesitated at all
between the &ldquo;impropriety&rdquo; of interfering in a matter
which was no business of mine and the &ldquo;infernal
shame&rdquo; of refusing my aid at such a conjecture, I soon came
to a very ungentlemanly decision, namely, that I would be guilty
of the &ldquo;impropriety,&rdquo; and not of the &ldquo;infernal
shame.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seemed to me that the immediate arrest of
Mohammed Damoor was the one thing needful to the safety of the
Jews, and I <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>felt confident (for reasons which I have already
mentioned in speaking of the Nablus affair) that I should be able
to obtain this result by making a formal application to the
Governor.&nbsp; I told my applicants that I would take this step
on the following morning.&nbsp; They were very grateful, and
were, for a moment, much pleased at the prospect of safety which
might thus be opened to them, but the deliberation of a minute
entirely altered their views, and filled them with new
terror.&nbsp; They declared that any attempt, or pretended
attempt, on the part of the Governor to arrest Mohammed Damoor
would certainly produce an immediate movement of the whole
Mussulman population, and a consequent massacre and robbery of
the Israelites.&nbsp; My visitors went out, and remained I know
not how long consulting with their brethren, but all at last
agreed that their present perilous and painful position was
better than a certain and immediate attack, and that if Mohammed
Damoor was seized, their second estate would be worse than their
first.&nbsp; I myself did not think that this would be the case,
but I could not of course force my aid upon the people against
their will; and, moreover, the day fixed for the fulfilment of
this second prophecy was not very close at hand.&nbsp; A little
delay, therefore, in providing against the impending danger would
not necessarily be fatal.&nbsp; The men now confessed that
although they had come with so much mystery and, as they thought,
at so great a risk to ask my assistance, they were unable to
suggest any mode in which I could aid them, except indeed by
mentioning their grievances to the consul-general at
Damascus.&nbsp; This I promised to do, and this I did.</p>
<p>My visitors were very thankful to me for the <a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>readiness
which I had shown to intermeddle in their affairs, and the
grateful wives of the principal Jews sent to me many compliments,
with choice wines and elaborate sweetmeats.</p>
<p>The course of my travels soon drew me so far from Safed, that
I never heard how the dreadful day passed off which had been
fixed for the accomplishment of the second prophecy.&nbsp; If the
predicted spoliation was prevented, poor Mohammed Damoor must
have been forced, I suppose, to say that he had prophesied in a
metaphorical sense.&nbsp; This would be a sad falling off from
the brilliant and substantial success of the first
experiment.</p>

284</span>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">DAMASCUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a part of two days I wound
under the base of the snow-crowned Djibel el Sheik, and then
entered upon a vast and desolate plain, rarely pierced at
intervals by some sort of withered stem.&nbsp; The earth in its
length and its breadth and all the deep universe of sky was
steeped in light and heat.&nbsp; On I rode through the fire, but
long before evening came there were straining eyes that saw, and
joyful voices that announced, the sight of Shaum
Shereef&mdash;the &ldquo;holy,&rdquo; the &ldquo;blessed&rdquo;
Damascus.</p>
<p>But that which at last I reached with my longing eyes was not
a speck in the horizon, gradually expanding to a group of roofs
and walls, but a long, low line of blackest green, that ran right
across in the distance from east to west.&nbsp; And this, as I
approached, grew deeper, grew wavy in its outline.&nbsp; Soon
forest trees shot up before my eyes, and robed their broad
shoulders so freshly, that all the throngs of olives as they rose
into view looked sad in their proper dimness.&nbsp; There were
even now no houses to see, but only the minarets peered out from
the midst of shade into the glowing sky, and bravely touched the
sun.&nbsp; There seemed to be here no <a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>mere city, but rather a province
wide and rich, that bounded the torrid waste.</p>
<p>Until about a year, or two years, before the time of my going
there Damascus had kept up so much of the old bigot zeal against
Christians, or rather, against Europeans, that no one dressed as
a Frank could have dared to show himself in the streets; but the
firmness and temper of Mr. Farren, who hoisted his flag in the
city as consul-general for the district, had soon put an end to
all intolerance of Englishmen.&nbsp; Damascus was safer than
Oxford. <a name="citation283"></a><a href="#footnote283"
class="citation">[283]</a>&nbsp; When I entered the city in my
usual dress there was but one poor fellow that wagged his tongue,
and him, in the open streets, Dthemetri horsewhipped.&nbsp;
During my stay I went wherever I chose, and attended the public
baths without molestation.&nbsp; Indeed, my relations with the
pleasanter portion of the Mahometan population were upon a much
better footing here than at most other places.</p>
<p>In the principal streets of Damascus there is a path for
foot-passengers, which is raised, I think, a foot or two above
the bridle-road.&nbsp; Until the arrival of the British
consul-general none but a Mussulman <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>had been permitted to walk upon the
upper way.&nbsp; Mr. Farren would not, of course, suffer that the
humiliation of any such exclusion should be submitted to by an
Englishman, and I always walked upon the raised path as free and
unmolested as if I had been in Pall Mall.&nbsp; The old usage
was, however, maintained with as much strictness as ever against
the Christian Rayahs and Jews: not one of them could have set his
foot upon the privileged path without endangering his life.</p>
<p>I was lounging one day, I remember, along &ldquo;the paths of
the faithful,&rdquo; when a Christian Rayah from the bridle-road
below saluted me with such earnestness, and craved so anxiously
to speak and be spoken to, that he soon brought me to a
halt.&nbsp; He had nothing to tell, except only the glory and
exultation with which he saw a fellow-Christian stand level with
the imperious Mussulmans.&nbsp; Perhaps he had been absent from
the place for some time, for otherwise I hardly know how it could
have happened that my exaltation was the first instance he had
seen.&nbsp; His joy was great.&nbsp; So strong and strenuous was
England (Lord Palmerston reigned in those days), that it was a
pride and delight for a Syrian Christian to look up and say that
the Englishman&rsquo;s faith was his too.&nbsp; If I was vexed at
all that I could not give the man a lift and shake hands with him
on level ground, there was no alloy to <i>his</i> pleasure.&nbsp;
He followed me on, not looking to his own path, but keeping his
eyes on me.&nbsp; He saw, as he thought, and said (for he came
with me on to my quarters), the period of the Mahometan&rsquo;s
absolute ascendency, the beginning of the
Christian&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He had so closely associated the
insulting privilege of the path with actual dominion, that seeing
it now in one instance abandoned, he <a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>looked for the quick coming of
European troops.&nbsp; His lips only whispered, and that
tremulously, but his fiery eyes spoke out their triumph in long
and loud hurrahs: &ldquo;I, too, am a Christian.&nbsp; My foes
are the foes of the English.&nbsp; We are all one people, and
Christ is our King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I poorly deserved, yet I liked this claim of
brotherhood.&nbsp; Not all the warnings which I heard against
their rascality could hinder me from feeling kindly towards my
fellow-Christians in the East.&nbsp; English travellers, from a
habit perhaps of depreciating sectarians in their own country,
are apt to look down upon the Oriental Christians as being
&ldquo;dissenters&rdquo; from the established religion of a
Mahometan empire.&nbsp; I never did thus.&nbsp; By a natural
perversity of disposition, which my nursemaids called
contr<i>ai</i>riness, I felt the more strongly for my creed when
I saw it despised among men.&nbsp; I quite tolerated the
Christianity of Mahometan countries, notwithstanding its humble
aspect and the damaged character of its followers.&nbsp; I went
further, and extended some sympathy towards those who, with all
the claims of superior intellect, learning, and industry, were
kept down under the heel of the Mussulmans by reason of their
having <i>our</i> faith.&nbsp; I heard, as I fancied, the faint
echo of an old Crusader&rsquo;s conscience, that whispered and
said, &ldquo;Common cause!&rdquo;&nbsp; The impulse was, as you
may suppose, much too feeble to bring me into trouble; it merely
influenced my actions in a way thoroughly characteristic of this
poor sluggish century, that is, by making me speak almost as
civilly to the followers of Christ as I did to their Mahometan
foes.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;holy&rdquo; Damascus, this &ldquo;earthly
paradise&rdquo; <a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>of the Prophet, so fair to the eyes that he dared not
trust himself to tarry in her blissful shades, she is a city of
hidden palaces, of copses and gardens, and fountains and bubbling
streams.&nbsp; The juice of her life is the gushing and ice-cold
torrent that tumbles from the snowy sides of Anti-Lebanon.&nbsp;
Close along on the river&rsquo;s edge, through seven sweet miles
of rustling boughs and deepest shade, the city spreads out her
whole length.&nbsp; As a man falls flat, face forward on the
brook, that he may drink and drink again, so Damascus, thirsting
for ever, lies down with her lips to the stream and clings to its
rushing waters.</p>
<p>The chief places of public amusement, or rather, of public
relaxation, are the baths and the great caf&eacute;; this last,
which is frequented at night by most of the wealthy men, and by
many of the humbler sort, consists of a number of sheds, very
simply framed and built in a labyrinth of running streams, which
foam and roar on every side.&nbsp; The place is lit up in the
simplest manner by numbers of small pale lamps strung upon loose
cords, and so suspended from branch to branch, that the light,
though it looks so quiet amongst the darkening foliage, yet leaps
and brightly flashes as it falls upon the troubled waters.&nbsp;
All around, and chiefly upon the very edge of the torrents,
groups of people are tranquilly seated.&nbsp; They all drink
coffee, and inhale the cold fumes of the <i>narghile</i>; they
talk rather gently the one to the other, or else are
silent.&nbsp; A father will sometimes have two or three of his
boys around him; but the joyousness of an Oriental child is all
of the sober sort, and never disturbs the reigning calm of the
land.</p>
<p>It has been generally understood, I believe, that <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>the houses
of Damascus are more sumptuous than those of any other city in
the East.&nbsp; Some of these, said to be the most magnificent in
the place, I had an opportunity of seeing.</p>
<p>Every rich man&rsquo;s house stands detached from its
neighbours at the side of a garden, and it is from this cause no
doubt that the city (severely menaced by prophecy) has hitherto
escaped destruction.&nbsp; You know some parts of Spain, but you
have never, I think, been in Andalusia: if you had, I could
easily show you the interior of a Damascene house by referring
you to the Alhambra or Alcanzar of Seville.&nbsp; The lofty rooms
are adorned with a rich inlaying of many colours and illuminated
writing on the walls.&nbsp; The floors are of marble.&nbsp; One
side of any room intended for noonday retirement is generally
laid open to a quadrangle, in the centre of which there dances
the jet of a fountain.&nbsp; There is no furniture that can
interfere with the cool, palace-like emptiness of the
apartments.&nbsp; A divan (which is a low and doubly broad sofa)
runs round the three walled sides of the room.&nbsp; A few
Persian carpets (which ought to be called Persian rugs, for that
is the word which indicates their shape and dimensions) are
sometimes thrown about near the divan; they are placed without
order, the one partly lapping over the other, and thus disposed,
they give to the room an appearance of uncaring luxury; except
these (of which I saw few, for the time was summer, and fiercely
hot), there is nothing to obstruct the welcome air, and the whole
of the marble floor from one divan to the other, and from the
head of the chamber across to the murmuring fountain, is
thoroughly open and free.</p>
<p>So simple as this is Asiatic luxury!&nbsp; The Oriental <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>is not a
contriving animal; there is nothing intricate in his
magnificence.&nbsp; The impossibility of handing down property
from father to son for any long period consecutively seems to
prevent the existence of those traditions by which, with us, the
refined modes of applying wealth are made known to its
inheritors.&nbsp; We know that in England a newly-made rich man
cannot, by taking thought and spending money, obtain even the
same-looking furniture as a gentleman.&nbsp; The complicated
character of an English establishment allows room for subtle
distinctions between that which is <i>comme il faut</i>, and that
which is not.&nbsp; All such refinements are unknown in the East;
the Pasha and the peasant have the same tastes.&nbsp; The broad
cold marble floor, the simple couch, the air freshly waving
through a shady chamber, a verse of the Koran emblazoned on the
wall, the sight and the sound of falling water, the cold fragrant
smoke of the <i>narghile</i>, and a small collection of wives and
children in the inner apartments&mdash;all these, the utmost
enjoyments of the grandee, are yet such as to be appreciable by
the humblest Mussulman in the empire.</p>
<p>But its gardens are the delight, the delight and the pride of
Damascus.&nbsp; They are not the formal parterres which you might
expect from the Oriental taste; they rather bring back to your
mind the memory of some dark old shrubbery in our northern isle,
that has been charmingly <i>un</i>-&ldquo;kept up&rdquo; for many
and many a day.&nbsp; When you see a rich wilderness of wood in
decent England, it is like enough that you see it with some soft
regrets.&nbsp; The puzzled old woman at the lodge can give small
account of &ldquo;the family.&rdquo;&nbsp; She thinks it is
&ldquo;Italy&rdquo; that has made the whole circle of her world
so <a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>gloomy and sad.&nbsp; You avoid the house in lively
dread of a lone housekeeper, but you make your way on by the
stables; you remember that gable with all its neatly nailed
trophies of fitchets and hawks and owls, now slowly falling to
pieces; you remember that stable, and that&mdash;but the doors
are all fastened that used to be standing ajar, the paint of
things painted is blistered and cracked, grass grows in the yard;
just there, in October mornings, the keeper would wait with the
dogs and the guns&mdash;no keeper now; you hurry away, and gain
the small wicket that used to open to the touch of a lightsome
hand&mdash;it is fastened with a padlock (the only new looking
thing), and is stained with thick, green damp; you climb it, and
bury yourself in the deep shade, and strive but lazily with the
tangling briars, and stop for long minutes to judge and determine
whether you will creep beneath the long boughs and make them your
archway, or whether perhaps you will lift your heel and tread
them down under foot.&nbsp; Long doubt, and scarcely to be ended
till you wake from the memory of those days when the path was
clear, and chase that phantom of a muslin sleeve that once
weighed warm upon your arm.</p>
<p>Wild as that, the nighest woodland of a deserted home in
England, but without its sweet sadness, is the sumptuous garden
of Damascus.&nbsp; Forest trees, tall and stately enough if you
could see their lofty crests, yet lead a tussling life of it
below, with their branches struggling against strong numbers of
bushes and wilful shrubs.&nbsp; The shade upon the earth is black
as night.&nbsp; High, high above your head, and on every side all
down to the ground, the thicket is hemmed in and choked up by the
interlacing boughs that droop with the weight of roses, and load
the <a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>slow
air with their damask breath. <a name="citation292"></a><a
href="#footnote292" class="citation">[292]</a>&nbsp; There are no
other flowers.&nbsp; Here and there, there are patches of ground
made clear from the cover, and these are either carelessly
planted with some common and useful vegetable, or else are left
free to the wayward ways of Nature, and bear rank weeds,
moist-looking and cool to the eyes, and freshening the sense with
their earthy and bitter fragrance.&nbsp; There is a lane opened
through the thicket, so broad in some places that you can pass
along side by side; in some so narrow (the shrubs are for ever
encroaching) that you ought, if you can, to go on the first and
hold back the bough of the rose-tree.&nbsp; And through this
wilderness there tumbles a loud rushing stream, which is halted
at last in the lowest corner of the garden, and there tossed up
in a fountain by the side of the simple alcove.&nbsp; This is
all.</p>
<p>Never for an instant will the people of Damascus attempt to
separate the idea of bliss from these wild gardens and rushing
waters.&nbsp; Even where your best affections are concerned, and
you, prudent preachers, &ldquo;hold hard&rdquo; and turn aside
when they come near the mysteries of the happy state, and we
(prudent preachers too), we will hush our voices, and never
reveal to finite beings the joys of the &ldquo;earthly
paradise.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">PASS OF THE LEBANON</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> ruins of
Baalbec!&rdquo;&nbsp; Shall I scatter the vague, solemn thoughts
and all the airy phantasies which gather together when once those
words are spoken, that I may give you instead tall columns and
measurements true, and phrases built with ink?&nbsp; No, no; the
glorious sounds shall still float on as of yore, and still hold
fast upon your brain with their own dim and infinite meaning.</p>
<p>Come!&nbsp; Baalbec is over; I got &ldquo;rather well&rdquo;
out of that.</p>
<p>The path by which I crossed the Lebanon is like, I think, in
its features to one which you must know, namely, that of the
Foorca in the Bernese Oberland.&nbsp; For a great part of the way
I toiled rather painfully through the dazzling snow, but the
labour of ascending added to the excitement with which I looked
for the summit of the pass.&nbsp; The time came.&nbsp; There was
a minute in the which I saw nothing but the steep, white shoulder
of the mountain, and there was another minute, and that the next,
which showed me a nether heaven of fleecy clouds that floated
along far down in the air beneath me, and showed me beyond the
breadth of all Syria west of the Lebanon.&nbsp; But chiefly I
clung with my eyes to the dim, steadfast <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>line of the
sea which closed my utmost view.&nbsp; I had grown well used of
late to the people and the scenes of forlorn Asia&mdash;well used
to tombs and ruins, to silent cities and deserted plains, to
tranquil men and women sadly veiled; and now that I saw the even
plain of the sea, I leapt with an easy leap to its yonder shores,
and saw all the kingdoms of the West in that fair path that could
lead me from out of this silent land straight on into shrill
Marseilles, or round by the pillars of Hercules to the crash and
roar of London.&nbsp; My place upon this dividing barrier was as
a man&rsquo;s puzzling station in eternity, between the birthless
past and the future that has no end.&nbsp; Behind me I left an
old, decrepit world; religions dead and dying; calm tyrannies
expiring in silence; women hushed and swathed, and turned into
waxen dolls; love flown, and in its stead mere royal and
&ldquo;paradise&rdquo; pleasures.&nbsp; Before me there waited
glad bustle and strife; love itself, an emulous game; religion, a
cause and a controversy, well smitten and well defended; men
governed by reasons and suasion of speech; wheels going, steam
buzzing&mdash;a mortal race, and a slashing pace, and the devil
taking the hindmost&mdash;taking <i>me</i>, by Jove! (for that
was my inner care), if I lingered too long upon the difficult
pass that leads from thought to action.</p>
<p>I descended and went towards the west.</p>
<p>The group of cedars remaining on this part of the Lebanon is
held sacred by the Greek Church on account of a prevailing notion
that the trees were standing at a time when the temple of
Jerusalem was built.&nbsp; They occupy three or four acres on the
mountain&rsquo;s side, and many of them are gnarled in a way that
implies great age, but except these signs I saw nothing in their
appearance or conduct that <a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>tended to prove them contemporaries
of the cedars employed in Solomon&rsquo;s Temple.&nbsp; The final
cause to which these aged survivors owed their preservation was
explained to me in the evening by a glorious old fellow (a
Christian chief), who made me welcome in the valley of
Eden.&nbsp; In ancient times the whole range of the Lebanon had
been covered with cedars, and as the fertile plains beneath
became more and more infested by Government officers and tyrants
of high and low degree, the people by degrees abandoned them and
flocked to the rugged mountains, which were less accessible to
their indolent oppressors.&nbsp; The cedar forests gradually
shrank under the axe of the encroaching multitudes, and seemed at
last to be on the point of disappearing entirely, when an aged
chief who ruled in this district, and who had witnessed the great
change effected even in his own lifetime, chose to say that some
sign or memorial should be left of the vast woods with which the
mountains had formerly been clad, and commanded accordingly that
this group of trees (which was probably situated at the highest
point to which the forest had reached) should remain
untouched.&nbsp; The chief, it seems, was not moved by the notion
I have mentioned as prevailing in the Greek Church, but rather by
some sentiment of veneration for a great natural feature&mdash;a
sentiment akin, perhaps, to that old and earthborn religion,
which made men bow down to creation before they had yet learnt
how to know and worship the Creator.</p>
<p>The chief of the valley in which I passed the night was a man
of large possessions, and he entertained me very
sumptuously.&nbsp; He was highly intelligent, and had had the
sagacity to foresee that Europe would intervene authoritatively
in the affairs <a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>of Syria.&nbsp; Bearing this idea in mind, and with a
view to give his son an advantageous start in the ambitious
career for which he was destined, he had hired for him a teacher
of the Italian language, the only accessible European
tongue.&nbsp; The tutor, however, who was a native of Syria,
either did not know or did not choose to teach the European forms
of address, but contented himself with instructing his pupil in
the mere language of Italy.&nbsp; This circumstance gave me an
opportunity (the only one I ever had, or was likely to have) <a
name="citation296"></a><a href="#footnote296"
class="citation">[296]</a> of hearing the phrases of Oriental
courtesy in a European tongue.&nbsp; The boy was about twelve or
thirteen years old, and having the advantage of being able to
speak to me without the aid of an interpreter, he took a
prominent part in doing the honours of his father&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; He went through his duties with untiring assiduity,
and with a kind of gracefulness which by mere description can
scarcely be made intelligible to those who are unacquainted with
the manners of the Asiatics.&nbsp; The boy&rsquo;s address
resembled a little that of a highly polished and insinuating
Roman Catholic priest, but had more of girlish gentleness.&nbsp;
It was strange to hear him gravely and slowly enunciating the
common and extravagant compliments of the East in good Italian,
and in soft, persuasive tones.&nbsp; I recollect that I was
particularly amused at the gracious obstinacy with which he
maintained that the house in which I was so hospitably
entertained belonged not to his father, but to me.&nbsp; To say
this once was only to use the common form of speech, signifying
no more than our sweet word &ldquo;welcome,&rdquo; but the
amusing part of the matter was that, whenever in the <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>course of
conversation I happened to speak of his father&rsquo;s house or
the surrounding domain, the boy invariably interfered to correct
my pretended mistake, and to assure me once again with a gentle
decisiveness of manner that the whole property was really and
exclusively mine, and that his father had not the most distant
pretensions to its ownership.</p>
<p>I received from my host much, and (as I now know) most true,
information respecting the people of the mountains, and their
power of resisting Mehemet Ali.&nbsp; The chief gave me very
plainly to understand that the mountaineers, being dependent upon
others for bread and gunpowder (the two great necessaries of
martial life), could not long hold out against a power which
occupied the plains and commanded the sea; but he also assured
me, and that very significantly, that if this source of weakness
were provided against, <i>the mountaineers were to be depended
upon</i>; he told me that in ten or fifteen days the chiefs could
bring together some fifty thousand fighting men.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">SURPRISE OF SATALIEH </span><a
name="citation298a"></a><a href="#footnote298a"
class="citation">[298a]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> I was remaining upon the
coast of Syria I had the good fortune to become acquainted with
the Russian Sataliefsky, <a name="citation298b"></a><a
href="#footnote298b" class="citation">[298b]</a> a general
officer, who in his youth had fought and bled at Borodino, but
was now better known among diplomats by the important trust
committed to him at a period highly critical for the affairs of
Eastern Europe.&nbsp; I must not tell you his family name; my
mention of his title can do him no harm, for it is I, and I only,
who have conferred it, in consideration of the <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>military
and diplomatic services performed under my own eyes.</p>
<p>The General as well as I was bound for Smyrna, and we agreed
to sail together in an Ionian brigantine.&nbsp; We did not
charter the vessel, but we made our arrangement with the captain
upon such terms that we could be put ashore upon any part of the
coast that we might choose.&nbsp; We sailed, and day after day
the vessel lay dawdling on the sea with calms and feeble breezes
for her portion.&nbsp; I myself was well repaid for the painful
restlessness which such weather occasions, because I gained from
my companion a little of that vast fund of interesting knowledge
with which he was stored, knowledge a thousand times the more
highly to be prized since it was not of the sort that is to be
gathered from books, but only from the lips of those who have
acted a part in the world.</p>
<p>When after nine days of sailing, or trying to sail, we found
ourselves still hanging by the mainland to the north of the isle
of Cyprus, we determined to disembark at Satalieh, and to go on
thence by land.&nbsp; A light breeze favoured our purpose, and it
was with great delight that we neared the fragrant land, and saw
our anchor go down in the bay of Satalieh, within two or three
hundred yards of the shore.</p>
<p>The town of Satalieh <a name="citation299"></a><a
href="#footnote299" class="citation">[299]</a> is the chief place
of the Pashalic in which it is situate, and its citadel is the
residence of the Pasha.&nbsp; We had scarcely dropped our anchor
when a boat from the shore came alongside with officers on board,
who announced that the strictest orders had been received for
maintaining <a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>a quarantine of three weeks against all vessels coming
from Syria, and directed accordingly that no one from the vessel
should disembark.&nbsp; In reply we sent a message to the Pasha,
setting forth the rank and titles of the General, and requiring
permission to go ashore.&nbsp; After a while the boat came again
alongside, and the officers declaring that the orders received
from Constantinople were imperative and unexceptional, formally
enjoined us in the name of the Pasha to abstain from any attempt
to land.</p>
<p>I had been hitherto much less impatient of our slow voyage
than my gallant friend, but this opposition made the smooth sea
seem to me like a prison, from which I must and would break
out.&nbsp; I had an unbounded faith in the feebleness of Asiatic
potentates, and I proposed that we should set the Pasha at
defiance.&nbsp; The General had been worked up to a state of a
most painful agitation by the idea of being driven from the shore
which smiled so pleasantly before his eyes, and he adopted my
suggestion with rapture.</p>
<p>We determined to land.</p>
<p>To approach the sweet shore after a tedious voyage, and then
to be suddenly and unexpectedly prohibited from
landing&mdash;this is so maddening to the temper, that no one who
had ever experienced the trial would say that even the most
violent impatience of such restraint is wholly inexcusable.&nbsp;
I am not going to pretend, however, that the course which we
chose to adopt on the occasion can be perfectly justified.&nbsp;
The impropriety of a traveller&rsquo;s setting at naught the
regulations of a foreign State is clear enough, and the bad taste
of compassing such a purpose by mere gasconading is still more
glaringly plain.&nbsp; I knew perfectly well that if the <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>Pasha
understood his duty, and had energy enough to perform it, he
would order out a file of soldiers the moment we landed, and
cause us both to be shot upon the beach, without allowing more
contact than might be absolutely necessary for the purpose of
making us stand fire; but I also firmly believed that the Pasha
would not see the befitting line of conduct nearly so well as I
did, and that even if he did know his duty, he would hardly
succeed in finding resolution enough to perform it.</p>
<p>We ordered the boat to be got in readiness, and the officers
on shore seeing these preparations, gathered together a number of
guards, who assembled upon the sands.&nbsp; We saw that great
excitement prevailed, and that messengers were continually going
to and fro between the shore and the citadel.&nbsp; Our captain,
out of compliment to his Excellency, had provided the vessel with
a Russian war-flag, which he had hoisted alternately with the
Union Jack, and we agreed that we would attempt our
disembarkation under this, the Russian standard!&nbsp; I was glad
when we came to that resolution, for I should have been sorry to
engage the honoured flag of England in such an affair as that
which we were undertaking.&nbsp; The Russian ensign was therefore
committed to one of the sailors, who took his station at the
stern of the boat.&nbsp; We gave particular instructions to the
captain of the brigantine, and when all was ready, the General
and I, with our respective servants, got into the boat, and were
slowly rowed towards the shore.&nbsp; The guards gathered
together at the point for which we were making, but when they saw
that our boat went on without altering her course, <i>they ceased
to stand very still</i>; none of them ran away, or even shrank
back, but they looked as if <i>the pack were being shuffled</i>,
<a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>every
man seeming desirous to change places with his neighbour.&nbsp;
They were still at their post, however, when our oars went in,
and the bow of our boat ran up&mdash;well up upon the beach.</p>
<p>The General was lame by an honourable wound received at
Borodino, and could not without some assistance get out of the
boat; I, therefore, landed the first.&nbsp; My instructions to
the captain were attended to with the most perfect accuracy, for
scarcely had my foot indented the sand when the four six-pounders
of the brigantine quite gravely rolled out their brute
thunder.&nbsp; Precisely as I had expected, the guards and all
the people who had gathered about them gave way under the shock
produced by the mere sound of guns, and we were all allowed to
disembark with the least molestation.</p>
<p>We immediately formed a little column, or rather, as I should
have called it, a procession, for we had no fighting aptitude in
us, and were only trying, as it were, how far we could go in
frightening full-grown children.&nbsp; First marched the sailor
with the Russian flag of war bravely flying in the breeze, then
came the General and I, then our servants, and lastly, if I
rightly recollect, two more of the brigantine&rsquo;s crew.&nbsp;
Our flag-bearer so exulted in his honourable office, and bore the
colours aloft with so much of pomp and dignity, that I found it
exceedingly hard to keep a grave countenance.&nbsp; We advanced
towards the castle, but the people had now had time to recover
from the effect of the six-pounders (only of course loaded with
powder), and they could not help seeing not only the numerical
weakness of our party, but the very slight amount of wealth and
resource which it seemed to imply.&nbsp; They began to hang round
us more closely, and just as this reaction was <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>beginning,
the General, who was perfectly unacquainted with the Asiatic
character, thoughtlessly turned round in order to speak to one of
the servants.&nbsp; The effect of this slight move was
magical.&nbsp; The people thought we were going to give way, and
instantly closed round us.&nbsp; In two words, and with one
touch, I showed my comrade the danger he was running, and in the
next instant we were both advancing more pompously than
ever.&nbsp; Some minutes afterwards there was a second appearance
of reaction, followed again by wavering and indecision on the
part of the Pasha&rsquo;s people, but at length it seemed to be
understood that we should go unmolested into the audience
hall.</p>
<p>Constant communication had been going on between the receding
crowd and the Pasha, and so when we reached the gates of the
citadel we saw that preparations were made for giving us an
awe-striking reception.&nbsp; Parting at once from the sailors
and our servants, the General and I were conducted into the
audience hall; and there at least I suppose the Pasha hoped that
he would confound us by his greatness.&nbsp; The hall was nothing
more than a large whitewashed room.&nbsp; Oriental potentates
have a pride in that sort of simplicity, when they can contrast
it with the exhibition of power, and this the Pasha was able to
do, for the lower end of the hall was filled with his
officers.&nbsp; These men, of whom I thought there were about
fifty or sixty, were all handsomely, though plainly, dressed in
the military frockcoats of Europe; they stood in mass, and so as
to present a hollow semi-circular front towards the upper end of
the hall at which the Pasha sat; they opened a narrow lane for us
when we entered, and as soon as we had passed they again closed
up their ranks.&nbsp; An attempt was made to induce us to remain
at a <a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>respectful distance from his mightiness.&nbsp; To have
yielded in this point would have been fatal to our success,
perhaps to our lives; but the General and I had already
determined upon the place which we should take, and we rudely
pushed on towards the upper end of the hall.</p>
<p>Upon the divan, and close up against the right hand corner of
the room, there sat the Pasha, his limbs gathered in, the whole
creature coiled up like an adder.&nbsp; His cheeks were deadly
pale, and his lips perhaps had turned white, for without moving a
muscle the man impressed me with an immense idea of the wrath
within him.&nbsp; He kept his eyes inexorably fixed as if upon
vacancy, and with the look of a man accustomed to refuse the
prayers of those who sue for life.&nbsp; We soon discomposed him,
however, from this studied fixity of feature, for we marched
straight up to the divan and sat down, the Russian close to the
Pasha, and I by the side of the Russian.&nbsp; This act
astonished the attendants, and plainly disconcerted the
Pasha.&nbsp; He could no longer maintain the glassy stillness of
the eyes which he had affected, and evidently became much
agitated.&nbsp; At the feet of the satrap there stood a trembling
Italian.&nbsp; This man was a sort of medico in the
potentate&rsquo;s service, and now in the absence of our
attendants he was to act as interpreter.&nbsp; The Pasha caused
him to tell us that we had openly defied his authority, and had
forced our way on shore in the teeth of his own officers.</p>
<p>Up to this time I had been the planner of the enterprise, but
now that the moment had come when all would depend upon able and
earnest speechifying, I felt at once the immense superiority of
my gallant friend, and gladly left to him the whole conduct of <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>this
discussion.&nbsp; Indeed he had vast advantages over me, not only
by his superior command of language and his far more spirited
style of address, but also in his consciousness of a good cause;
for whilst I felt myself completely in the wrong, his Excellency
had really worked himself up to believe that the Pasha&rsquo;s
refusal to permit our landing was a gross outrage and
insult.&nbsp; Therefore, without deigning to defend our conduct,
he at once commenced a spirited attack upon the Pasha.&nbsp; The
poor Italian doctor translated one or two sentences to the Pasha,
but he evidently mitigated their import.&nbsp; The Russian,
growing warm, insisted upon his attack with redoubled energy and
spirit; but the medico, instead of translating, began to shake
violently with terror, and at last he came out with his <i>non
ardisco</i>, and fairly confessed that he dared not interpret
fierce words to his master.</p>
<p>Now then, at a time when everything seemed to depend upon the
effect of speech, we were left without an interpreter.</p>
<p>But this very circumstance, which at first appeared so
unfavourable, turned out to be advantageous.&nbsp; The General,
finding that he could not have his words translated, ceased to
speak in Italian, and recurred to his accustomed French; he
became eloquent.&nbsp; No one present except myself understood
one syllable of what he was saying, but he had drawn forth his
passport, and the energy and violence with which, as he spoke, he
pointed to the graven Eagle of all the Russias, began to make an
impression.&nbsp; The Pasha saw at his side a man not only free
from every the least pang of fear, but raging, as it seemed, with
just indignation, and thenceforward he plainly began to think
that, in some way or other (he could not tell how) he must
certainly have been in the wrong.&nbsp; In <a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>a little
time he was so much shaken that the Italian ventured to resume
his interpretation, and my comrade had again the opportunity of
pressing his attack upon the Pasha.&nbsp; His argument, if I
rightly recollect its import, was to this effect: &ldquo;If the
vilest Jews were to come into the harbour, you would but forbid
them to land, and force them to perform quarantine; yet this is
the very course, O Pasha, which your rash officers dared to think
of adopting with <i>us</i>!&mdash;those mad and reckless men
would have actually dealt towards a Russian general officer and
an English gentleman as if they had been wretched
Israelites!&nbsp; Never&mdash;never will we submit to such an
indignity.&nbsp; His Imperial Majesty knows how to protect his
nobles from insult, and would never endure that a general of his
army should be treated in matter of quarantine as though he were
a mere Eastern Jew!&rdquo;&nbsp; This argument told with great
effect.&nbsp; The Pasha fairly admitted that he felt its weight,
and he now only struggled to obtain such a compromise as might
partly save his dignity.&nbsp; He wanted us to perform a
quarantine of one day for form&rsquo;s sake, and in order to show
his people that he was not utterly defied; but finding that we
were inexorable, he not only abandoned his attempt, but promised
to supply us with horses.</p>
<p>When the discussion had arrived at this happy conclusion,
<i>tchibouques</i> and coffee were brought, and we passed, I
think, nearly an hour in friendly conversation.&nbsp; The Pasha,
it now appeared, had once been a prisoner of war in Russia, and a
conviction of the Emperor&rsquo;s vast power, necessarily
acquired during this captivity, made him perhaps more alive than
an untravelled Turk would have been to the force of my
comrade&rsquo;s eloquence.</p>
<p><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>The
Pasha now gave us a generous feast.&nbsp; Our promised horses
were brought without much delay.&nbsp; I gained my loved saddle
once more, and when the moon got up and touched the heights of
Taurus, we were joyfully winding our way through the first of his
rugged defiles.</p>

308</span>APPENDIX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE HOME OF LADY HESTER
STANHOPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late when we came in sight
of two high conical hills, on one of which stands the village of
Djouni, on the other a circular wall, over which dark trees were
waving; and this was the place in which Lady Hester Stanhope had
finished her strange and eventful career.&nbsp; It had formerly
been a convent, but the Pasha of Sidon had given it to the
&ldquo;prophet-lady,&rdquo; who converted its naked walls into a
palace, and its wilderness into gardens.</p>
<p>The sun was setting as we entered the enclosure, and we were
soon scattered about the outer court, picketing our horses,
rubbing down their foaming flanks, and washing out their
wounds.&nbsp; The buildings that constituted the palace were of a
very scattered and complicated description, covering a wide space
but only one storey in height: courts and garden, stables and
sleeping-rooms, halls of audience and ladies&rsquo; bowers, were
strangely intermingled.&nbsp; Heavy weeds were growing everywhere
among the open portals, and we forced our way with difficulty
through a tangle of roses and jasmine to the inner court; here
choice flowers once bloomed, and fountains played in <a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>marble
basins, but now was presented a scene of the most melancholy
desolation.&nbsp; As the watchfire blazed up, its gleam fell upon
masses of honeysuckle and woodbine, on white, mouldering walls
beneath, and dark, waving trees above; while the group of
mountaineers who gathered round its light, with their long beards
and vivid dresses, completed the strange picture.</p>
<p>The clang of sword and spear resounded through the long
galleries; horses neighed among bowers and boudoirs; strange
figures hurried to and fro among the colonnades, shouting in
Arabic, English, and Italian; the fire crackled, the startled
bats flapped their heavy wings, and the growl of distant thunder
filled up the pauses in the rough symphony.</p>
<p>Our dinner was spread on the floor in Lady Hester&rsquo;s
favourite apartment; her deathbed was our sideboard, her
furniture our fuel, her name our conversation.&nbsp; Almost
before the meal was ended two of our party had dropped asleep
over their trenchers from fatigue; the Druses had retired from
the haunted precincts to their village; and W&mdash;, L&mdash;,
and I went out into the garden to smoke our pipes by Lady
Hester&rsquo;s lonely tomb.&nbsp; About midnight we fell asleep
upon the ground, wrapped in our capotes, and dreamed of ladies
and tombs and prophets till the neighing of our horses announced
the dawn.</p>
<p>After a hurried breakfast on fragments of the last
night&rsquo;s repast we strolled out over the extensive
gardens.&nbsp; Here many a broken arbour and trellis, bending
under masses of jasmine and honeysuckle, show the care and taste
that were once lavished on this wild but beautiful hermitage; a
garden-house, surrounded by an enclosure of roses run wild, lies
in <a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>the
midst of a grove of myrtle and bay trees.&nbsp; This was Lady
Hester&rsquo;s favourite resort during her lifetime; and now,
within its silent enclosure,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;After life&rsquo;s fitful fevers he sleeps
well.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hand of ruin has dealt very sparingly with all these
interesting relics; the Pasha&rsquo;s power by day, and the fear
of spirits by night, keep off marauders; and though <i>we</i>
made free with broken benches and fallen doorposts for fuel, we
reverently abstained from displacing anything in the
establishment except a few roses, which there was no living thing
but bees and nightingales to regret.&nbsp; It was one of the most
striking and interesting spots I ever witnessed: its silence and
beauty, its richness and desolation, lent to it a touching and
mysterious character, that suited well the memory of that strange
hermit-lady who has made it a place of pilgrimage, even in
Palestine. <a name="citation310"></a><a href="#footnote310"
class="citation">[310]</a></p>
<p>The Pasha of Sidon presented Lady Hester with the deserted
convent of Mar Elias on her arrival in his country, and this she
soon converted into a fortress, garrisoned by a band of
Albanians: her only attendants besides were her doctor, her
secretary, and some female slaves.&nbsp; Public rumour soon
busied <a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>itself with such a personage, and exaggerated her
influence and power.&nbsp; It is even said that she was crowned
Queen of the East at Palmyra by fifty thousand Arabs.&nbsp; She
certainly exercised almost despotic power in her neighbourhood on
the mountain; and what was perhaps the most remarkable proof of
her talents, she prevailed on some Jews to advance large sums of
money to her on her note of hand.&nbsp; She lived for many years,
beset with difficulties and anxieties, but to the last she held
on gallantly; even when confined to her bed and dying she sought
for no companionship or comfort but such as she could find in her
own powerful, though unmanageable, mind.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, our consul at Beyrout, hearing she was ill, rode
over the mountains to visit her, accompanied by Mr. Thomson, the
American missionary.&nbsp; It was evening when they arrived, and
a profound silence was over all the palace.&nbsp; No one met
them; they lighted their own lamps in the outer court, and passed
unquestioned through court and gallery until they came to where
<i>she</i> lay.&nbsp; A corpse was the only inhabitant of the
palace, and the isolation from her kind which she had sought so
long was indeed complete.&nbsp; That morning thirty-seven
servants had watched every motion of her eye: its spell once
darkened by death, every one fled with such plunder as they could
secure.&nbsp; A little girl, adopted by her and maintained for
years, took her watch and some papers on which she had set
peculiar value.&nbsp; Neither the child nor the property were
ever seen again.&nbsp; Not a single thing was left in the room
where she lay dead, except the ornaments upon her person.&nbsp;
No one had ventured to touch these; even in death she seemed able
to protect herself.&nbsp; At midnight her <a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>countryman
and the missionary carried her out by torchlight to a spot in the
garden that had been formerly her favourite resort, and here they
buried the self-exiled lady.&mdash;<i>From</i> &ldquo;<span

the labours of Schliemann and Dorpfeld have excavated Hissarlik,
commonly considered to be the site of Troy, though some prefer to
identify the city of the <i>Iliad</i> with the ruins of Bunar
Bashi, farther inland.&nbsp; Hissarlik is a huge mound, in a
singularly desolate plain about an hour&rsquo;s ride from Kum
Kale, at the entrance of the Dardanelles, and is said to be
composed of the ruins of no less than eight or nine cities placed
one on the top of the other.&nbsp; Of the older layers the best
preserved are the second and sixth cities.&nbsp; There are no
statues, inscriptions, or other indications, so that the
structure of this pile of dead towns is excessively difficult to
understand, and only becomes intelligible when explained by
someone thoroughly acquainted with the course of the excavations;
for in order to reach the lower layers it has naturally been
necessary to displace the upper ones.&nbsp; The general character
of the scene is still excellently described by Byron&rsquo;s
lines in <i>Don Juan</i>, Cant. iv.:</p>

having little merchandise of their own to dispose of, they are
sadly importunate in offering their services as intermediaries:
their troublesome conduct has led to the custom of beating them
in the open streets.&nbsp; It is usual for Europeans to carry
long sticks with them, for the express purpose of keeping off the
chosen people.&nbsp; I always felt ashamed to strike the poor
fellows myself, but I confess to the amusement with which I
witnessed the observance of this custom by other people.&nbsp;
The Jew seldom got hurt much, for he was always expecting the
blow, and was ready to recede from it the moment it came: one
could not help being rather gratified at seeing him bound away so
nimbly, with his long robes floating out in the air, and then
again wheel round, and return with fresh importunities.</p>

should attempt to read the following account of the late Lady
Hester Stanhope except those who may already chance to feel an
interest in the personage to whom it relates.&nbsp; The chapter
(which has been written and printed for the reasons mentioned in
the preface) is chiefly filled with the detailed conversation, or
rather discourse, of a highly eccentric gentlewoman.</p>
<p><a name="footnote90a"></a><a href="#citation90a"

<p><a name="footnote92"></a><a href="#citation92"
class="footnote">[92]</a>&nbsp; This was my impression at the
time of writing the above passage, an impression created by the
popular and uncontradicted accounts of the matter, as well as by
the tenor of Lady Hester&rsquo;s conversation.&nbsp; I have now
some reason to think that I was deceived, and that her sway in
the desert was much more limited than I had supposed.&nbsp; She
seems to have had from the Bedouins a fair five hundred
pounds&rsquo; worth of respect, and not much more.</p>
<p><a name="footnote96"></a><a href="#citation96"
class="footnote">[96]</a>&nbsp; She spoke it, I daresay, in
English; the words would not be the less effective for being
spoken in an unknown tongue.&nbsp; Lady Hester, I believe, never
learnt to speak the Arabic with a perfect accent.</p>
<p><a name="footnote99"></a><a href="#citation99"
class="footnote">[99]</a>&nbsp; The proceedings thus described to
me by Lady Hester as having taken place during her illness, were
afterwards re-enacted at the time of her death.&nbsp; Since I
wrote the words to which this note is appended, I received from
Warburton an interesting account of the heroine&rsquo;s death, or
rather the circumstances attending the discovery of the event;
and I caused it to be printed in the former editions of this
work.&nbsp; I must now give up the borrowed ornament, and omit my
extract from my friend&rsquo;s letter, for the rightful owner has
reprinted it in <i>The Crescent and the Cross</i>.&nbsp; I know
what a sacrifice I am making, for in noticing the first edition
of this book reviewers turned aside from the text to the note,
and remarked upon the interesting information which
Warburton&rsquo;s letter contained.&nbsp; (This narrative is
reproduced in an Appendix to the present edition.)</p>
<p><a name="footnote102"></a><a href="#citation102"
class="footnote">[102]</a>&nbsp; In a letter which I afterwards
received from Lady Hester, she mentioned incidentally Lord
Hardwicke, and said that he was &ldquo;the kindest-hearted man
existing&mdash;a most manly, firm character.&nbsp; He comes from
a good breed&mdash;all the Yorkes excellent, with <i>ancient</i>
French blood in their veins.&rdquo;&nbsp; The underscoring of the
word &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; is by the writer of the letter, who
had certainly no great love or veneration for the French of the
present day: she did not consider them as descended from her
favourite stock.</p>

hear what is said concerning themselves, and it would seem that
those who live without books or newspapers know all that is
written about them.&nbsp; Lady Hester Stanhope, though not
admitting a book or newspaper into her fortress, seems to have
known the way in which M. Lamartine mentioned her in his book,
for in a letter which she wrote to me after my return to England
she says, &ldquo;Although neglected, as Monsieur le M.&rdquo;
(referring, as I believe, to M. Lamartine) &ldquo;describes, and
without books, yet my head is organised to supply the want of
them as well as acquired knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

recognise this as the true sanctuary, and many Protestants look
upon all the traditions by which it is attempted to ascertain the
holy places of Palestine as utterly fabulous.&nbsp; For myself, I
do not mean either to affirm or deny the correctness of the
opinion which has fixed upon this as the true site, but merely to
mention it as a belief entertained without question by my
brethren of the Latin Church, whose guest I was at the
time.&nbsp; It would be a great aggravation of the trouble of
writing about these matters if I were to stop in the midst of
every sentence for the purpose of saying &ldquo;so called&rdquo;
or &ldquo;so it is said,&rdquo; and would besides sound very
ungraciously: yet I am anxious to be literally true in all I
write.&nbsp; Now, thus it is that I mean to get over my
difficulty.&nbsp; Whenever in this great bundle of papers or book
(if book it is to be) you see any words about matters of religion
which would seem to involve the assertion of my own opinion, you
are to understand me just as if one or other of the qualifying
phrases above mentioned had been actually inserted in every
sentence.&nbsp; My general direction for you to construe me thus
will render all that I write as strictly and actually true as if
I had every time lugged in a formal declaration of the fact that
I was merely expressing the notions of other people.</p>

ceremony is not correct.&nbsp; The form of prayer called in
Turkey Namaz, which ought to be performed by every devout Moslem
five times a day, does necessarily involve prostrations in which
the forehead touches the ground, but it is by no means the only,
though doubtless the most important, act of worship mentioned by
Islam.&nbsp; In the present case the ceremony was probably a
blessing, which is generally given by closing the eyes and
uplifting the arms with the hands bent back and the palms
open.&nbsp; I have often seen such benedictions given when a
party sets out for a pilgrimage or any other purpose.)</p>

bravado in my manner of talking about the plague.&nbsp; I have
been more careful to describe the terrors of other people than my
own.&nbsp; The truth is, that during the whole period of my stay
at Cairo I remained thoroughly impressed with a sense of my
danger.&nbsp; I may almost say, that I lived in perpetual
apprehension, for even in sleep, as I fancy, there remained with
me some faint notion of the peril with which I was
encompassed.&nbsp; But fear does not necessarily damp the
spirits; on the contrary, it will often operate as an excitement,
giving rise to unusual animation, and thus it affected me.&nbsp;
If I had not been surrounded at this time by new faces, new
scenes, and new sounds, the effect produced upon my mind by one
unceasing cause of alarm might have been very different.&nbsp; As
it was, the eagerness with which I pursued my rambles among the
wonders of Egypt was sharpened and increased by the sting of the
fear of death.&nbsp; Thus my account of the matter plainly
conveys an impression that I remained at Cairo without losing my
cheerfulness and buoyancy of spirits.&nbsp; And this is the
truth, but it is also true, as I have freely confessed, that my
sense of danger during the whole period was lively and
continuous.</p>

carry infection, according to the notions of the Europeans.&nbsp;

time of my doing so) I avoided that part of the luxury which
consists in being &ldquo;put up to dry&rdquo; upon a kind of
bed.</p>

After a few brief prayers at the graveside, the mourners retire
forty paces, halt, and pray again.&nbsp; It is believed that at
this moment two angels visit the deceased, inquire of his
religious belief, and, if he replies in the words of the formula,

consists of twelve lunar months, and is eleven days shorter than
the Christian year.&nbsp; Hence, if in one year Muharrem (the
first month) falls on April 29, it would fall on April 18 the
next.&nbsp; In consequence of the great inconveniences of this
mode of reckoning, Turks adopt for secular matters another era
called the Financial year, which starts from the Hijra, but has
solar months.&nbsp; But feasts and fasts are fixed by the lunar
year, so that the month of Ramazan rotates through all the

of this chapter are altogether inaccurate.&nbsp; From the
religious point of view a good Mohammedan is as much, and more,
bound than a Christian to encourage any form of missionary
enterprise, seeing that all non-Moslems are destined to
inevitable damnation.&nbsp; From the legal and practical point of
view, the exercise of all religions is nominally free in Turkey
and it is therefore illegal to convert a Christian at the point
of the sword, but it will be sufficient to remind the reader that
during the massacres of 1895&ndash;96 many thousands of Armenians
turned Mohammedans, and that those who wished to subsequently
return to their old religion found great difficulty in doing
so.</p>
<p>As a rule Turks despise the Christian races too much to take
any trouble about converting them, but it is absurd to say that
conversions are illegal.&nbsp; On the contrary, they are fairly
frequent, and it is only necessary that the person converted
should state publicly that his change of religion is due to his
own free will.&nbsp; Cases of young girls embracing Islam are not
rare.&nbsp; According to the law, minors wishing to become
Moslems must be taken to the house of a respectable person, where
a priest of their own religion can have access to them, and their
change of faith is not legal until they are of age (which means
in the case of a girl twelve or thirteen), but in practice every
effort is made to isolate them in such cases from their friends
and surround them with Mohammedans.]</p>

disdained, and rejected, and insulted him (not because he

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
